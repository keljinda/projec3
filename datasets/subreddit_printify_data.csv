When creating an Etsy account they were asking me to post a product. I do not want to do that. I want my Printify store to connect to Etsy. How do I do it? Which one do I set up first? Or Is that Etsy's process of approving me before I connect Printify?

I will be grateful for information on that. Thank you. "

My questions, is it final profit or Etsy might have extra expenses? I'm guessing there is got to be taxes cut from the profit too? I set margin profit for 40% for certain products, but it's so higher than the other seller's  afraid it will scare byers off."
Anyone having issues with Printify integration with Amazon regarding the shipping?,1,1gp1c4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1gp1c4g/anyone_having_issues_with_printify_integration/,0,2024-11-12 02:52:04,"I've seen this comment via YouTube and I'm having the same issue:

""am setting up my first shipping profile and it looks like they may have made some changes already. For the Transit time, it has a drop down of choices but all of them are shorter options ranging form 1-2 days up to 5-8 days, it doesn't have the 14-28 days shown in your video. The first provider and product I am trying to set up has a shipping time of 6-9 days so none of these transit times fit into what they offer, what should I do in that situation? Also, in the region section it separates out my state into its own section and it wont allow me to put it in with the other states. As a result it has a shorter transit time listed, the longest option it gives me is 2-4 days since it probably thinks I am shipping from my state, which I am not. This could potentially make all my shipments seem like they are late..."" 

Printify responded under the comment ""Hi there! Starting soon, Amazon will require sellers to have standard 5 day shipping and free 8 day economy options. Currently,  we're working to make sure we can help our sellers meet the 5 day requirement.

I recently made my first sale on Etsy, and my customer was charged $35:  
$25 for the product  
$10 for shipping and fees

My product's production cost is $15, and the profit estimated is $7 per sale. Printify also lists ""buyer shipping cost"" as $10.

After my sale on Etsy however, Printify charged me $25, seemingly for production + shipping.

Why is this? My customer already paid for shipping? I lost money on the order and support is completely unhelpful."

"Listing broken in printify for one certain product, they said they put in a tech ticket 2 Days ago.",1,1gontqi,https://i.redd.it/hwyprw3oj80e1.jpeg,2,2024-11-11 15:46:06,"I have a listing on my Etsy store that's linked to printify. It is based on the white ceramic mug, 11 oz by generic brand that is fulfilled by Colorway. 

There's no options for different kinds of shipping on this product. But it is telling me that there's an error where it can't send the order to colorway because I've picked economy shipping. When I check my listing it says standard shipping and then on my printify invoice it says standard shipping $0 (instead of the usual price next to standard shipping)

I've already been in a chat with the printify team and they said they put in an IT ticket 2 days ago but I'm worried that the time is going to run out for me to have the item printed and sent to my customer. When I follow the link that printify sent me to fix the order, there's literally no options to choose from under shipping (it's just a blank gray box with no buttons) This is true on my existing listing or if I create a new listing for the same brand of mug. I checked creating a new listing because I thought maybe there had been a site update and my listing was somehow obsolete but listings are broken for that product either way.

Other kinds of listings like t-shirts, the printing options still work just fine. That makes me think it's not a problem with my account but with that product fulfilled by Colorway. I also just logged into printify from my personal Google account and tried to create a listing from that brand mug and shipping is still blank if I go to do a manual order.

I really would rather not switch to another brand because I ordered test prints from Colorway to make sure the quality was what I wanted and other brands I tried did not do a good job. 

Has anyone had any experience with this happening or with the print if I help people having to place an IT ticket for you? I'm hoping since it appears to be a problem with the product that it would be a priority for them because it would affect any customer that tried to order this, but once again I'm just really concerned that they're not going to figure it out in time for me to fulfill my customers order."

I created a product in printify called the Gildan 5000B kids tshirt, everywhere I check the size its coming up with a youth tshirt. I class kids as like 2-8year olds and youth anything north of that. This has confused me now because even the measurements are not making sense to me (UK sizing is usually in ages for kids).

Anyway, went to look at the toddler tshirts, they have sizes up to 7T? DOES THIS MEAN 7YEARS OLD. Am i just thick???? Or is printify just misusing words? 

Toddlers most definitely are not 4-7year olds. 

Someone help me out with the sizing and wth I am doing. I need ages like 2-3 3-4 5-6 like how the UK does it. 

P.s I tried to look at conversion charts, chest (full circumference) and width are used interchangeably so its just confusing.

My popup store has T-Shirts that are just $17 for smaller sizes, but my 2x and larger are $25. The popup store is displaying the $25 3x size shirts, instead of the lower tier, smaller sizes. What retailer does this? You always show your best price...not your highest priced option. And what is really annoying,  the display problem is somewhat random. I can post 5 shirts....and four of them will display a 3x price, and one of them will display a medium size price!  Anyone else seeing this on their popups?"

My Printify profit margin is set to 40%

Ebay first takes a 13.25% fee (17.25$)
Then an ""international"" fee (2$)
Then another 0.4$ fee that is firm for every sale you make.
And on top of those it takes a 20% VAT (3.89$)
In total the Ebay fees are around 23.34$

And now it's Printify's turn
It costs about 73$ to produce and then 18$ to ship.

So my fees total to nearly 115$ WHAT
I used a 10$ coupon printify provided me after finding out about it.
So my total take was like 17 dollars.

But the fees dont end there. I have to change my revenue into my local currency and will have to pay for that as well. Which I think will total to 5$.

So I will be selling a 122$ product for just 12 bucks. What the hell... What is even the point?

Which is heavier: ""Matte"" or ""Coated (both sides)"", when we're talking about 270gsm greeting card paper?

I just ordered one of each as a  5x7 sample of the ""[Greeting Cards (1, 10, 30, and 50pcs)](https://printify.com/app/products/1094/generic-brand/greeting-cards-1-10-30-and-50pcs)"" — printed by Taylor. 

My problem: I ordered one card in ""Matte"", and the other in ""Coated (both sides)"". They look equally good, but I prefer the one that's slightly heavier. But I can't figure out which paper stock it is!! I should have made a variation in the test text, to remember.

If anyone is curious: I am very happy with the quality, and we used a high-rez photo on the cover and a line of colored text inside. FYI: to know my standards, I'm a graphic designer by trade who has printed 200-page offset books of photography.

I'm specifically looking for a heavyweight white-colored t-shirt that isn't see-through or super thin and flimsy.

If you have experience with any of the following models, I'd love to have some feedback.

>\- Bella+Canvas 3001

>\- American Apparel 1301

>\- Next Level 3600

From the few pictures I've seen online it seems like the Next Level 3600 is quite see-through so I might stay away from it. I'm obviously not interested in showing my beautiful nipples to the whole world.

Which one of those would be your best in terms of overall quality and fit ?

I have been using Printify for about six months...I have several hundred T-Shirt designs, in multiple niches, spread over 2 Popup Shops and I have several Ebay accounts synced with Printify.  I see other Printify users experiencing some of the same issues I have had. Everytime Printify ""improves"" the platform,  they seem to break something else. I won't bore you with past events, but I have a current problem I want to share. Let me first say that Printify Customer service has been very helpful and courteous,  and do their best to help,  but they are limited in their solutions.  Starting approx 2 weeks ago, I discovered that when I post a new design, or update a previously posted design (ie change price, update mock ups, etc) to one of my PopUp shops, the platform no longer defaults to the lowest retail price option. For instance, my Small to XL shirts are one price,  and 2X are higher,  and 3x plus are more. For 6 months, every posted design defaulted to the lowest price option without exception...which was displayed on the Popup Store front. Now, out of the blue, the system defaults them to the most expensive option. So, the customer who would normally order a small shirt, are seeing the price for a 5x. Sometimes, the new or updated design defaults to the lowest cost option....there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why and when it chooses the price option to display.  Customer service acts like this has always been the case, and that there is no way to select the lowest price option for display.  Their ""work around"" is to price all designs based on an average price of available options.  This problem is maddening  and is making the PopUp store useless when I can not control what price will be displayed. Has anyone noticed this problem? Thank you in advance."

Purpose : To provide a highly realistic, AI-generated rendering of the product that closely matches the actual item. The images are crafted to accurately reflect the product's style, fit, details, dimensions, and ect, ensuring customers have a clear and lifelike visual representation. While minor variations in color or details may occur in real life, the AI rendering is designed to deliver a precise and reliable preview of the product's real-life appearance.

(Not asking about the colors or background ect, that can be changed easily and will depend on item, but more about the quality specifically. Would you use this ? Thank you very much for you feedback.)

EDIT : I had A LOT of requests so I took a few days to set up a website for digital downloads, I uploaded Gildan 18000 mockups today (I don't even know if I can say this here ?? Ik I can't add a link so come to chat and I'll give you the link)

However, zero sales. I had been reviewing the avg. shipping estimates when I create designs/projects.  Tonight, I went in and decided to place a fake order for two items (sweatshirt and mug).  I entered the quantity as 2 for each item.  I realize they ship from different providers but when shipping costs are as much as the actual items, there is no way a buyer will pay that much forcing the creator to lower their profit to try to make it feasible.  For context:  The shipping was ONLY from US printers and to Atlanta, GA area.  Are the shipping fees inflated with Printify or is it standard with all POD to be insanely high?

I sell other items so I can control quality there obviously. But I ordered several samples of new stuff. I ordered a sweatshirt and a T shirt on October 8. The sweatshirt went into processing and showed up on the 16th. That's great. HOWEVER... 

The T shirt sat in processing and flipped over to shipping with a tracking number on the 13th after not moving at all for 5 days. Monday was a holiday so I was already suspicious as USPS isn't running on Columbus day. That order never shipped and sat with USPS is awaiting item the entire week. I contacted Printify on that Friday to say what's up...  They give me some crazy nonsense about 2-5 days for shipping and processing. But I understand that to mean to ship the item and it was well beyond that at that point. I understand processing times. I sell online. I also know a label can be printed and sat on for days. They refunded me. I reordered it. I just got it and it's got dirt spots on the neck and on the body of the shirt. It looks like it's been trampled on. Like absolute trash quality. I've sold some products via printify thus far but I've not pushed it and now I'm questioning all my life choices and thinking I should just buy the damn shirts and do it myself as I have a heatpress. I just don't want to have to worry about the inventory. Is there a quality issue generally?  Like I just thought about a customer opening that and had a panic attack. I think it's pretty shitty to have businesses invest in working with them and then not give two shits about quality. It also makes me nervous. I'm checking into other POD providers for T shirts and sweatshirts. And will probably be pulling down all the Printify listings. Is anyone planning on moving or experienced anything similar?  "

I am a student and want to start a PoD business but because I am a resident of a war-torn country, I can't even open an account with payment gateways and other things ( so I can't start the business I want).

I have a good PoD business module starting from niches, marketing strategies, Company legislations to the ad campaigns etc. The idea is to start with almost no money as this business model works like cycle itself. Just We need to dedicate time for the first configurations.

I can provide the details and the plan to anybody who wants, I don't want access to the payment accounts or the bank details or whatever, just I will share the business model and want a share of the net profit.

I am looking for a business partner to start, I will give the ideas and what we should do. The business partner just needs to create accounts and fund this business at the beginning. 

If you want to be my business partner, I am really looking forward to chatting with you.

Thank you."

But there are pitfalls nobody tells you about. 

For example, you might fill in ""Business name (optional)"" while creating your Google ads account with the name of your Shopify store. Seems reasonable, right? But what they don't tell you is that when you fill this in it means you're creating a \*\*business account\*\*, so you need an EIN to continue running ads. Having a one-man shopify store with no employees, you don't have an EIN, but you've now committed to the business account, which will not run anything without your (nonexistent) business info.

So, since Google Ads provides \*no\* recourse to fix this, I created a new individual account, which has promptly been suspended. I'm guessing because I created the new account to ""get around"" the invisible wall they've set up for new users. 

The only reason they get away with this obnoxious behavior is that they are a monopoly. Sadly, they have no competitors so you have to go through them!! "

How to? → Create canvas wall art in 3 sizes at different prices but personalized with different options (initials?),3,1g6s7ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1g6s7ti/how_to_create_canvas_wall_art_in_3_sizes_at/,2,2024-10-19 03:42:27,"Hi there!

I run an Etsy canvas wall art shop where I offer hundreds of pieces facilitated by Printify POD, many diptychs and triptychs, but I wanted to offer some personalized options, too. As an example, this is how all of my current listings are formatted:  
[https://pixelmagicbybrandi.etsy.com/listing/1717843616](https://pixelmagicbybrandi.etsy.com/listing/1717843616)

What I'd like to explore doing is offering some personalization options — I'm super open to ideas — but what I was thinking was finding one or two really colorful, welcoming designs and offering versions with all the letters of the alphabet so people could get their first or last initial. I was thinking of picking one design for this and offering these variations: canvas size, price, personalized initial. I would love to also have variations that offer a different design background, maybe 2-4, but I think that's probably pushing the complication level here. 

Can anyone help me figure out how to set this up? Both the single background option and the multiple... all with options for a personalized initial in caps. I've been Googling and watching videos and nothing is making it click yet. If it's just the first option — one background design — and I make like 5 listings, that is also fine if it cuts down the complication level.

Thank you SO MUCH ahead of time for any help and resources!"

That being said, how do I know when the system will automatically check me off as legit and in good standing to remove it, or is it ALWAYS a 90 day thing-even if I were to get a thousand sales in those 90 days.

The Best BFCM Email Marketing Guide,2,1g2j8j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1g2j8j5/the_best_bfcm_email_marketing_guide/,0,2024-10-13 13:06:43,"**Black Friday/Cyber Monday Email Marketing Guide**

Every year I make a post on here for BFCM based on my experience managing Email/SMS marketing for hundreds of brands. I always try to add the new things I’ve learned to improve the quality of the posts I made on Reddit last year.

This guide is targeted at store owners doing at least 25k+ per month, with an email list that has over 1500 people. If your store doesn’t meet these requirements, you’ll still learn a thing or 2 from this post & if you’re doing 250k+ per month, I'm sure your marketing for the most important month of the year is probably already sorted. So, for all you entrepreneurs in the middle, don’t fumble this. A well-executed Q4 can EASILY add 40% to your business's annual revenue.

 

**This is what you can do to improve your deliverability and conversion rate for BFCM:**

1. **Segment Your List** - Treat your VIP customers and your non-buyers differently. VIPs get early access and special treatment—they should feel appreciated for supporting your brand in the past & encouraged to do it again. Now is the time to make a PUSH to get people who bought last year ( Around this time ) onto your SMS list. I’m going to say some real shit. SMS will never be as good as emails, but if there’s 1 month where it makes sense to double down on SMS marketing it's November.
2. **Write Good Subject Lines** - Your subject line needs to stop people in their tracks. I’ve said this plenty of times, and I’ll say it again. There are 2 ways to create a good subject line. Either you’re extremely direct and say something like ""Our Black Friday Sale Starts NOW! Get 20% Off Everything!"" OR you create curiosity with something like “We’re giving away gifts to people in {{Customers\_City}}” (The “gift” can simply be a free add-on with purchases over X amount. Bonus points for personalizing the subject line, it’ll boost the open rate)
3. **Design Clean, Eye-Catching Emails -** Use templates if you don’t have a designer (hello, Canva). Make sure your emails are branded, easy to read, and mobile-friendly. Include urgency with countdown timers (Sendtric makes it easy to embed timers), and stick to one clear CTA (Call to Action). Whether the customer is looking for a Christmas gift or just a good deal, the email needs to flow in a way that ends with them checking out on your site.
4. **Create Urgency** - Use language that creates FOMO. Set clear start and end dates for your sale, and send reminders as the end approaches. Time-sensitive offers work best—let them know stock is limited, and they need to act fast. There's no better time to use scarcity and urgency than during BFCM. Go all out.
5. **Optimize for Deliverability -** Don’t blast out emails to your entire list at once, especially if you haven’t been emailing regularly (You can send to your full list if you have less than 5k members on it). Segment and prioritize your engaged subscribers to improve your chances of landing in the inbox instead of the spam folder.

 

**Here’s a basic sending schedule for November:**

**1. November 1 - Holiday Opt-Out Email**

* A courtesy email offering customers the chance to opt out of holiday promotions to maintain high engagement. An unengaged subscriber hurts you more than they help you.

**2. November 5 - Early Access VIP Announcement**

* Notify VIP customers about their exclusive early access to upcoming Black Friday sales to create excitement and reward loyalty.

**3. November 9 - Black Friday Sneak Peek**

* Tease your audience with a preview of your best Black Friday deals, building anticipation with a countdown to the sale. This is your chance to show off new collections and this leads perfectly into the hype email.

**4. November 15 - Hype Email**

* Build excitement as Black Friday approaches, reminding everyone of the upcoming sale and highlighting a few top deals to create buzz.

**5. November 20 - VIP Early Access Launch**

* Grant early access to your Black Friday sale for VIP customers, emphasizing exclusivity and creating urgency with limited stock and timeframes.

**6. November 24 - Black Friday Sale Launch**

* Officially launch your Black Friday sale with a bold, straightforward email promoting the biggest discounts and encouraging immediate action.

**7. November 27 - Black Friday Reminder Email**

* Send a reminder that Black Friday deals are ending soon, using urgency and FOMO to prompt last-minute purchases.

**8. November 30 - Cyber Monday Sale Launch**

* Kick off your Cyber Monday sale with new deals, offering customers another chance to shop and promoting items left from Black Friday.

**9. December 5- Thank you email**

* This is by far the most important email of the year. It's so important I made an entire post about it. This is your chance to send out a plain text email and simply express gratitude to your customers. I’ve sent this email nearly 100 times, it almost always outperforms every email that was sent out during the ENTIRE YEAR. It is by far, the most lucrative email I’ve ever sent out. Don’t forget to say Thank you.

 

Thank you for taking the time to read 1 of my many long-winded Reddit posts. I hope that you’ve gained something from my post, and I wish you the best for BFCM season."

Looking for Heavyweight Blank T-Shirts (Black & White) with Workwear Quality and a Great Fit,1,1g07nuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1g07nuz/looking_for_heavyweight_blank_tshirts_black_white/,0,2024-10-10 08:27:25,"Hey everyone,

I'm after **blank heavyweight T-shirts** in **black and white** with **durable, long-lasting fabric**—solid but not overly heavy. Fit is important as I’m **190 cm tall, 82 kg**, with **broad shoulders, long arms, and a lean frame**.

# What I’m Looking For:

* **Material**: Medium to heavyweight, sturdy, not see-through.
* **Fit**: Suits long arms, broad shoulders, but lean build. Sleeves shouldn’t be too tight or short.
* **Neckline**: Round neck, not too tight or loose.

# What I’ve Tried:

* **Carhartt**: Great fit and material, but the designs are boring (I plan to print my own).
* **Uniqlo & COS**: Good quality, but fit better on standard/Asian body types.
* **Trigema**: This shirt looks okay, though the sleeves might be a bit tight, even though I don't have the thickest arms [link](https://www.trigema.de/herren/t-shirts/T-Shirt-aus-100-Baumwolle-weiss-XL.html).

I’m looking for T-shirts that fit like **Carhartt** or the **vintage Gildan heavy/soft** shirts that were popular for cool prints—just **better quality**, **affordable**, and **long-lasting**.

Any **brands that ship to Germany** (preferably free over a certain value) that fit this? **Carhartt fit reference attached.**

Thanks!

I have a store I started months ago through shopify where I make products and use print providers through ""Printify"" to fullfill these orders. I thought this was going to be amazing because I odn't have to pay anything until the customer purchases. I've been experiencing things that I don't understand and the community online is hard to get answers and I am by no means a professional. I key in 40% profit margin and have customer pay for the shipping, yet each order there is a shortfall between what Im paid and what I have too pay printify. It just doesnt make sense I'm losing money to try and make money. There is a production cost as well I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it. Am I making the wrong assumption that if I have a product, I mark it up 40%, and customer pays for shipping... how does this keep happening??? Why aren't I making 40%?? I also feel like printify providers lie because it will say something like $10 shipping in Canada and then next thing you know i make a profduct and have to redo it becaus ewhen I do a ""mock"" checkout, it will say something ridiculous like $30 shipping which no one is going to think about even for a second. Really looking for some experienced and specific help to my problem, I've been looking into shipping profiles but theres too many of them I have 25 products.. I pick the shipping profile which is the company of each item so I'm not sure how the numbers keep getting edited after the sale. Thanks in advance Im out about $1000 and might have to just close this business after months of work, marketing, a business license etc.. great stuff to offer the world but it seems impossible to find a balance that works for all three parties and I could nenver do all this without the providers it would just be digital images. I feel like this shouldn't be rocket science but Printify makes it that way to take our money, they dont even have a phone number to call and their threads and FAQs are ridiculously unhelpful. The photos I'm attaching is actually the sale with the LEAST amount of money lost yet but still. Thanks.

I have been running a Shopify store for a few years, which now includes a few items from Printify. These items are meant to be sold internationally, as it is taking up too much time shipping the products myself. 

  
I launched the new product and immediately sold one to the US. The provider was in Germany, so the order got rerouted to a provider in the US. So far so good.

  
On shopify, the customer was charged 29 dollars for shipping. 

On Printify, the original shipping was 12 dollars, but got reduced to 4 dollars as it was rerouted. 

How much has my customer paid for the shipping? Why was he charged 29 dollars for shipping when Printify tells me it was only 12 dollars, which then got changed to 4 dollars. Where does the money go? Does the customer get reimbursed or what are the mechanics?

In that time, we have received 2 price increases on shipping.  How could they ""increase the shipping cost"" (technically - which is setting a new shipping cost), if they cant resolve the issue of why their shipping profiles don't work.  wouldn't that compound the problem.

No sales from ETSY. Decided to order samples and make some content to do some advertisement on social media. There is no way shipping should be $57USD to ship one pair of legging from Miami to Canada. 

I dont even want to order my own samples coast of shipping being too high. So I cant blame the clients for not buying any clothes.
And there is only one print shop who does the leggings and it is based in Miami. I wish there were more print providers.

Order total: 69.15 USD
Shipping: 57.28??

Printify inventory not syncing with Shopify,3,1fut7n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1fut7n1/printify_inventory_not_syncing_with_shopify/,6,2024-10-03 05:45:30,"Hi all! 

I am trying to set up a Shopify storefront attached to a Printify account. I've connected them so that the Printify products show up in the Shopify store's list of products, and I've organized them into collections on the storefront as well. However...

When I navigate to the Shopify store front in order to make a test purchase, all of the items say ""Out of Stock"" and I am unable to make a purchase.   
  
It's such a wide variety of products (lawn sign, t shirt, gummies, car mat) that there's no way they can ALL be out of stock from my Printify vendors at once. I'm guessing that even though the products have synced, for some reason Printify's inventory system is not syncing with Shopify. 

Anyone else run into this issue? "
Strange Potential Delay Error ,1,1fuzgjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1fuzgjm/strange_potential_delay_error/,1,2024-10-03 11:13:50,"Hello! So we just started expanding into a Tiktok shop after spending a lot of time on Etsy and eBay. We built our store and made our first listing, which went fairly smoothly. For some reason on the Printify end under our products, we are getting an alert for ""Requires Action"". I click into this, and it isn't exactly showing anything is wrong which is confusing. It appears to be the potential delay option, given that you need to select product directly out of their Tiktok eligible items. The problem is the shirt, all the variants, and the vendor are all listed as Tiktok eligible. (It's a simple Gildan 5000).

Has anyone seen this happen? We reached out to Printify who said they can't replicate the issue and as long as it's from their Tiktok-listed items, it will be good to go, but we still see these strange issue. It's concerning to us seeing this and don't want to get any violations out of the gates because of something not set up correctly.

Everything else appears to be good to go, yet it still shows an action required tab but nothing that would appear to cause any delays to the strict ship times for Tiktok. Any insight would be helpful! Thank you.

Monster Digital was just sleeping. It came in 1 month. Thankfully, they didn't have a problem with my address. Quality was really low.

Does Printify accept multiple files for one product?,1,1fthzlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1fthzlv/does_printify_accept_multiple_files_for_one/,16,2024-10-01 13:59:05,"I recently sent a help request to Printify.  I thought I'd also post my question here while I'm waiting to hear back from the review team.

I'm new to Printify and want to create some POD puzzles. I uploaded 4 separate files for the 4 available puzzle sizes (for ONE puzzle product).  In the Variants & Layers Panel, the DPI for my ""default"" design changed every time I added a variant!  This shouldn't be happening; the default design is based on its own unique file which is sized correctly. When I click back on the the default it reverts back to the proper 300 dpi setting. But as I click on each of the other sizes, the default variant DPI keeps increasing. I want to confirm that there isn't some weird interpolation going on with the default file. Please see the attachments for greater clarity.

* I just retested this issue with another image and found the same issue. This time I made the default image the smallest at 8x10 inches. I uploaded the other file sizes to my Printify library and created their variants (11x14, 16x20 & 20x30). This time, once in the product's Variants & Layers Panel section, every time I clicked on a file other than the 8x10 default version, the DPI decreased to unacceptable levels. *It seems that all 4 variants are based on whichever file is chosen to be the default image.* If this is correct, it means Printify only uses ONE file, the default file, to create all the other variants through some type of resizing algorithm. For a SINGLE puzzle product, I want to be able to upload 4 separate image files, one for each size variant.  I suppose I could use one file for the 16x20 and 8x10 since the aspect ratios are basically the same, but the 20x30 version has an aspect ratio that is not compatible with the others, and needs its own separate file.
* If I can't utilize multiple files to create the variants for my puzzle products, I don't see how I'll be able to use Printify as my POD provider for puzzles.  I imagine this same issue might be encountered when creating wall art products.  Any help, insight and info will be greatly appreciated!"

You used to be able to just intuitively click the mockup you wanted as the main photo, but I don't see how to do it now. I have tried selecting photos in different orders, deleting all mockups and adding them in the desired order, dragging the mockups around, etc. Nothing works; the mockups seem to appear in alphabetical order by shirt color.

Newbie here - can we chat? ,5,1fp0sbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1fp0sbf/newbie_here_can_we_chat/,12,2024-09-25 17:02:50,"Hey, hope everyone's well. I've decided for the second time now to open a shop using printify (this time on eBay) and I've hit the same roadblock that I hit last time.
My question is- do people REALLY spend this much money on these products? For example, my first shop idea was selling luxury wrapping paper, but after designing and creating the listing etc I just couldn't bring myself to believe that anybody would actually pay ~$20 for a couple of sheets of wrapping paper, not even considering shipping! So I gave up before I even started really, as I didn't want to waste my time.
Now I'm working on opening my eBay store selling kitchenware through printify and again, I've designed a tea towel (which I personally would buy myself as I think it's nicely aesthetically pleasing) but to get $8 profit I have to sell for $22!!
Do I just have a broke b*tch mentality? Or do people really spend this kind of money on stuff like this? I personally can't imagine spending anything over $8 for a basic sublimation printed mug, regardless of how good the design is, but here I am preparing to sell them for $15! 
It's mad lol, someone talk me down off this edge before I bin off the whole idea again.

I went in and changed that design to 2024, and then I saved it, and now I'm going to change my etsy listing to 2024 pictures.

Is that ok? Will it go to 2024 now because I changed the deleted the 2023 and it says 2024, or because it was bought with the 2023, it will default back to that?

Should I have canceled the order and then had them reorder or did I handle it the best way or did I screw myself over and they'll get the wrong design.

Procreate For Design and an Apology,2,1fi6nn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1fi6nn1/procreate_for_design_and_an_apology/,7,2024-09-16 21:53:45,"I’ve always designed with Canva. I’m not an actual artist. I have a good eye but no training at all. Yesterday, I was doodling in noteability for iPad and was annoyed by a few things so I asked a friend what she uses to design and she said Procreate. When procreate is suggested I’ve always assumed it was only for PROfessionals so I shied away from it and always suggest Canva to other newbies. I’ve watched 3 tutorials on it and I have to apologize for ever suggesting Canva. 

Canva for sure has its place in this POD/digital design world but woah I was missing out a lot of options for customizing my designs even more. I also think procreate will give me the ability to improve whatever tiny bit of skill I do have because it’s digital. 

Personally, I tend to get particularly frustrated with making mistake when I draw/paint on paper. Procreate will take the stress out of the possibility of absolutely ruining a painting with one wrong stroke. Is it the same as painting? No. But I feel like it does giving me the ability to experiment more! "

I’ve just managed to set up my Etsy store with Printify integration. 

The biggest problem I have is with pricing due to different currencies.

I’m from EU and my Etsy shop is in EUR. Printify supports only USD when setting prices.

How do I solve the issue with different prices? Because when I set prices in USD, they’re set in my shop as EUR. And then when a buyer sees that price in USD it’s of course even higher than in USD.

A little while later I check the order and all 5 of those t-shirts are now the same design. I freak out so I cancel the order. I make a duplicate and double check everything is correct. Send it to production, check 5 min later and it happens AGAIN. All 5 are the same.

I check some other orders and sure enough its happening to those as well. Seems to be happening to orders with at least 2 BLACK shirts. I've contacted printify but all they did was ask for the order number. I sent that when I first contacted them idk why they asked for it again.

From what I can tell, all I can do is toggle the ""Free shipping"" button in the Pricing Preferences.  However, if I don't toggle that on, it appears that I'm already giving them free shipping because I'm being charged for it. Are these the two ways to do it:

1. Leave Free Shipping turned off and just add the shipping amount to my price?  If I do this and I'm being charged for shipping, how will they know they're getting free shipping already?

2. Turn on Free Shipping in Printify and Printify will add the shipping cost to my price automatically and then it will say ""Free Shipping"" on my Etsy ad?

I haven't actually sold anything yet and I suspect my prices are a deterrent)

For example: Comfort Colours 1717 T-shirt. I currently have them listed at $36.95 in my Etsy shop.

Total production + shipping cost on Printify + Etsy fees has it coming up to about $34, which means I'm making about $2 profit on each shirt.

Are y'all just pricing at a deficit and hoping to sell in large quantities and then eating the cost if its a single sale or??

There’s no way to change SKU’s in Printify and amazon doesn’t allow any editing on this “missing offer” And how can I utilize the Amazon support that’s offered in your videos as an established seller—it doesn’t give me that option because I have an existing seller central account.

Last year, I did ceramic and glass ornaments - the ceramic got ordered like 10x more but I also had a lot more customer issues with them. Blurred text, bad print, etc. Some came out great, of course, but enough didn't that I found myself refunding a lot and dealing with some bad reviews. And unfortunately Printify only offers one supplier in the United States, so no options there.

This year I was thinking about switching the ceramic designs to metal ornaments - the print quality seems higher, from what reviewers on Youtube say. BUT...do metal ornaments sell? The ones printify offers are SUPER thin, like extremely thin, which I will definitely note in a picto-graphic or whatever on my listing, but I'm not sure if that will scare people away, or even if I do that, they'll complain once they get them. 

What is your experience with either ceramic or metal? opinions WELCOME, thanks so much!

Shipping Multiple Items - Question,1,1fatq33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1fatq33/shipping_multiple_items_question/,5,2024-09-07 06:53:58,"Hey team, have a somewhat convoluted question that I hope there's an easy answer for.

On Printify I'm looking to create some corkback coasters. I have a series of about 20 images I'd like to offer in a single Etsy listing, all themed around the same thing. I found the ""hack"" to add multiple SKU's to one Etsy listing that way I can have all the coasters in one listing and the customer can add as many as they'd like for their particular taste to their cart. All these are from the same printify provider.

My question is:

If I add these ~20 drink coaster SKU's, from the same printify provider, to my Etsy listing... will I get the ""additional shipping cost discount"" if a customer orders say... 6 coasters?

One coaster is about $6 for shipping costs, but each additional coaster is $1. I'm not finding anywhere that states for the additional shipping cost each additional coaster needs to be the same exact design... and I assume since they're all going to the same place, even though they're different designs/prints, that each coaster past the first one should qualify for the $1/coaster shipping discount, correct?

I just don't want to spend time creating 20 different printify products and attaching all their SKU's to one listing and then get a customer that orders 10 coasters in one order and I'm getting charged $6/coaster to ship them. Obviously that's not a winning business model.

Hoping someone has experience with how Printify treats these situations. Thanks!"

Etsy says the buyer paid about $17 shipping among other things. But when I checked out the order in Printify, it's charging me $60 for production (great, understand that) but also $30 for shipping.

Who are the best T-shirt print providers in the USA currently. Ive had issues with Monster and Swift,7,1f6zjya,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1f6zjya/who_are_the_best_tshirt_print_providers_in_the/,15,2024-09-02 13:01:26,"So I recently got multiple samples from SwiftPOD and Monster Digital and have had issue with both and some good with both. What providers do you use for your t-shirts I was thinking about testing out others like Dimona Tee.

**Monster Digital**

*Issues:*

* Cant do any type of textures / distressing good (I tested the 2 prints with monster and swift one of the ones monster Digital did, didn't do any of the distressing texture (swift did) and on the other it was like random small blotches of ink taken out instead of the distressed texture
* About half of the prints have been misaligned with the white underbase. On one print the white underboss on text made it look blurry
* there were other minor issues but not noteworthy
* Another separate sample order had cracking and peeling in 2 of my samples.

*The Good:*

* The colors came out a little more accurate than swiftPOD and a couple of the others I tested (though Printful's came out the best).
* The speed in which it went from purchase to delivered was only about 5 days



**SwiftPOD**

*Issues:*

* The colors were way off on 1 of the prints.
* On another print the colors were off as well and it they even printed white in some spots that were suppose to be blue. (I did the same exact design with multiple other providers and no other ones had that issue)
* Overall there colors were off at least for my sample order.

*The Good:*

* Did one of my design really well and handled the textured / distressed designs good as well (Not fully textured but close). Also the colors looked a little better but its hard to judge as this design I used very muted colors to begin with.
* The shipping was also the same speed a monster digital



**Underground Threads**

*The Good*

I only tested one sample with them as they don't carry many products I am looking for at the moment. I will say the print came out great so I wish they did cary the other stuff I wanted to sell.

*Minor complaint:*

* The only minor issue I had was that on the sample I got the whole front of the shirt was rough (the shirt itself without the print). I thought it might have been the fabric but the back of the shirt was not rough.



**Macro Fine Arts:**

* Only had one sample on a sweatshirt, came out good so no complaints. I wish I would have gotten a sample with my test design on the same shirts as the others though.



**Fulfill Engine**

* Also tested Fulfill engine and there shirts have an odd glue, paint smell (no like the vinegar smell). One print came out horrible cracked and peeling, the whole printing was the roughest I've felt on all samples. On the other sample it came out good, still rough and still had that smell. If anyone know what im talking about can you explain to me why that is.



So I wrote all this to share my limited experience with my samples. Id like to know if any of you with more experience, which providers do you feel are the best quality of prints for shirts.

If im overthinking things feel free to let me know that as well."

Printify Etsy Integration - How to deal with multiple products purchase?,3,1f6rwza,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1f6rwza/printify_etsy_integration_how_to_deal_with/,8,2024-09-02 06:08:38,"Hello!

Today I made a test with an extra Etsy account to see what happens with shipping calculations if I add a t-shirt and a hoodie to the same cart. In this case Etsy chose the hoodie shipping template like if the order were 2 hoodies, so I'd loose money by not charging the t-shirt shipping correctly.

How do you deal with this? Free shipping?

I was not choosing to use free shipping in the case the client wanted to buy more than one of the same item, since additional products costs in most cases half of the shipping for one item, and with free shipping they would pay the hole shipping price.

Should I configure free shipping for all my products? I don't know what to do! I read your comments!

Thank you! ♥

--

UPDATE: I solved this by offering free shipping to US and removing shipping outside US in all shipping profiles, this way I don't take risk on having orders with combined extra shipping fees. I hope someday Etsy is able to calculate multiple shipping prices in the same order."

Has any Canadian Etsy seller found success selling mugs in their shops for that price? Like what are y'all doing? I've seen some shops with lower shipping prices for the same Spoke mugs (like $15-17), are these people just willingly eating the extra dollars?

Is there an elegant solution yet for Same-Listing Etsy order routing for US/EU providers?,1,1f4m214,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1f4m214/is_there_an_elegant_solution_yet_for_samelisting/,4,2024-08-30 10:57:01,"I've read a number of threads and help articles on this topic, and it still seems like a mess.

Printify's tutorial page explained to create two unpublished (US & EU) listings within Printify, and the real listing on Etsy. When an order is received, manually import that order into Printify, using either your US or EU product.

Heck, I've even seen to make three, four even five duplicate listings, for example Canada or Australia.

Not only is this archaic, but defeats the purpose of any automation or efficiency.

It also states that ""alternatively"", you can use **Order Routing** instead.

However a deeper dive on people's experience on order routing claimed this still only applies within a certain region, and does NOT apply to using a single Etsy->Printify live, published listing, aka, selecting a US-based provider and having it route to an EU-based provider if the Etsy customer is in the EU.

HOWEVER.. Printify's own example again seems to contradict this:  
""You received an order from a customer in Germany for a t-shirt from a US-based print provider. We'll automatically send the order to a comparable provider located in Europe to fulfill the order, when available.""

It sounds to me like you can choose a US-based provider in Printify, market your ETSY listing as US & EU, and when Printify receives an EU order, it will route behind-the-scenes to an equivalent EU provider.

If this is true, I'm not sure why half a dozen threads *all recommend the double/triple listing hack*. Apparently this is what people are doing out there.

Any insight what's going on??"

If you just have a quick look at the mockup in the size that Printify provides it for download this does not catch the eye immediately. But if you look closer it is there. Now I understand that these are mockups and not print files but in regards to how important the main mockup of a product is for atttracing buyers on the likes of Etsy and so on, I wonder if that can be good for potential buyers to see - even if the print on the final product will be fine.

Forced Image Updates Broke Mockups In My Shopify Store,0,1ezh6a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1ezh6a0/forced_image_updates_broke_mockups_in_my_shopify/,3,2024-08-23 23:30:41,"I recently got notification from Printify that, since most of my t-shirts were in this new category called ""Printify Choice"", that they had to resize/scale my creative assets.  So, I had to go into each product and review the new placement of my artwork and then approve/save each product.

After re-publishing all of my t-shirts, all of my mockups were no longer the primary image on Shopify and, when I changed the color of a shirt on Shopify when ordering, the color of the shirt in the mockup didn't change.

Now, it looks like all of my image links are broken in Google Merchant Center as well.

However both, on Etsy and on eBay I have been suspended, without them giving me a clear reason why. I cannot appeal again to eBay and also on Etsy my suspension is confirmed.

I create designs which look like this: An AI created image, example: A Beaver with a bass guitar and my added writing: Funky Beaver or Groovin' Beaver, so a music shirt. To my knowledge usage of AI in creating designs isn't against their regulations. What could the reason be them suspending me multiple times?

I'm new to Printify and I have stumbled upon a problem of which I don't know how to solve.

I am uploading artwork for posters and you are given a long list of different sizes. But every size needs a different image scaled to its size. Instead of the editor just saving each image I scale to the size listed I can only work with one image per product and assign one scaled image per product. You end up with tons of separate products instead of just one product with a long dropdown menu with sizes you can select. I tried bypassing this by uploading more than one image and scaling them individually but this can get very messy and confusing very fast because they all overlap each other and you end up not knowing what belongs to what anymore (and you're only allowed to upload a certain amount of images per product.)

It's a little hard to explain what I mean but hopefully someone understands what I'm talking about and hopefully knows a solution I'm missing."

Not making any profit using Printify to sell items via Etsy,6,1ewpfim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1ewpfim/not_making_any_profit_using_printify_to_sell/,9,2024-08-20 14:23:20,"Hello, I was hoping somebody could help me as I’m really struggling to find any videos covering this.

I’ve recently started creating products on Printify to sell via Etsy however it seems I’m having to list journals at £20+ to make any form of profit once all the fees are deducted when, in my opinion, the quality of the journals aren’t worth this, and I wouldn’t pay this much for the product which arrives. I have more chance of selling them if they’re listed around £10 as it’s pretty small and no option to vary the size. 

I’m not sure if this is because I’m based in the UK so the options for direct shipment from suppliers based in the UK are more limited on Printify compared to the US, but I see so many journals/items being sold on Etsy which look like the same drop shipping companies are being used as me but they’re listing the items for way cheaper.

Does anyone know what I could be doing wrong? 

- I listed a journal for £17.48
- Printify charged me £13.95 
- Etsy deducted £6.91 

So I made a total loss of 38p overall rather than any profit. How are people making money?

Ideally I would like something like Printify's own Pop-Up store, but that is not available in the European Union, where I reside.

Basically I am looking for something that:

1. is external to my main online store, since I also sell mostly extra POD products and the attempt to integrate Printify to the shop was disastrous, with their bad plugin overwriting my shipping price settings and causing me to lose money.

2. don't credit me with the gross of the sale by then making me pay the charges to the platform but, like the pop-up store, take care of the management in full by then giving me the net. Otherwise, given my tax regime, I would be going to pay tax on a gross that is in fact not a profit.

3. Does not have fixed costs like Shopify or others. I have already wasted enough time and money with Printify.

Thanks to those who can answer me!"

Maybe others don’t have this issue, but every time I put sample orders for myself something gets lost and every three orders customers are requesting refunds due to lost packages or them just never showing up. I feel like I’m wasting so much of my time and energy and money into this corporation which is not fully set up themselves. I know about Printful, but I have heard many bad things about them too. Does anyone have advice to deal with this or just another good platform?

Update: Thanks to the comments from all these wonderful people I’ve learned it is just within Europe and Asia that this is an issue (probably just out of the US) and it depends on the print providers. Even though I’ve had this issue with the same products that shipping usually works fine. If your store is based in the US you’re fiiine!

I had them saved at 300 initially but happened to check the Printify drop down and saw 150 recommendation. 

Since I’m paranoid about files sizes I was happy to change them all to 150. Now I’m wondering if I should go back to 300 dpi. Thoughts? Experience with the item? I am just as paranoid about print quality.

Printify Tax Collection Process Question with WooCommerce--not asking for tax advice,1,1eo7qzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1eo7qzc/printify_tax_collection_process_question_with/,1,2024-08-10 01:51:57,"I'm NOT asking for tax advice. I want to understand the Prinfity tax collection process before spending more money.

1. I have an e-commerce page on my website I'm about to launch.
2. The page will sell print-on-demand items from Printify, and digital items will also be available for immediate download. 
3. The store is built using WordPress and WooCommerce.
4. I'm based in Illinois.
5. I have WooCommerce set to collect taxes based on the shipping address. 
6. When I tested, the store only collected taxes on products shipped to Illinois and not to any other state. (I understand this since IL is my home state, and I don't currently have Nexus with any other state.)
7. Even though I don't have Nexus with any other state, Printify will still collect taxes for any state where a product I sell is shipped. That means if I sell a product that gets shipped to New York, Printify will collect taxes for New York, but my site won't show those taxes to the customer because my site doesn't specifically have Nexus with New York, and WooCommerce doesn't think I need to collect New York sales tax.
8. I don't have resale licenses for other states, so I am not exempt from Printify collecting taxes.

Is my understanding above correct? If so, here are my questions.

1. If my site doesn't show and charge taxes for products shipped outside of Illinois, won't Printify take the tax amount out of my account anyway, thus reducing my profit?
2. Is there a free way to show and charge taxes for products shipped outside of Illinois using WooCommerce before reaching Nexus, aside from manually entering a tax rate for each state (and keeping up with it)? I looked at TaxCloud, but it appears that also only applied taxes for Illinois, not every state where Printify will collect tax.
3. If there's no cost-free way to apply taxes on my site, can I do this with TaxJar, or will that also only apply sales tax where I have Nexus?

  
I posted something similar on WooCommerce but didn't get a good answer, so I'm hoping someone using Printify and WooCommerce has already gone through this. Thanks."

Any way around paying for orders out of pocket?,2,1eig72v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1eig72v/any_way_around_paying_for_orders_out_of_pocket/,16,2024-08-03 00:37:58,"I'm pretty new to this. I made a Shopify store recently and my shirts are going through Printify. I made a shirt the other day that has started to get me some sales. The way it's currently working is that I'm paying production/shipping (to Printify) out of my own bank account, and then Shopify will *eventually* pay me back plus profit.

  
The issue is that I made this shop because I'm unemployed and broke. I'm printing on Comfort Color tees and, plus shipping, it's costing me $20+ per unit... So if I started getting a significant number of orders in the next couple of days, I literally can't afford to keep up...

  
I was under the assumption that the customer's payment would pay for all costs, and then I'd receive the profit. Is there a way to set that up? 

Also, any tips on reducing fees and costs would be appreciated because I gave my friends a discount code and I'm profiting like $0.75 on those once it's all said and done haha. (I was thinking I'd still be making closer to $4-5 on those)"

I just want to ask you guys.... Because I don't really understand this.... 

For an example. I want to print t-shirts. 
(I will make up the prices) 

Retail price would be for ie. 30 USD. 

Costs of production 9 for t-shirt. 5 for front print and 5 for the back print. Total of 19 usd... 

The customer pays for shipping 5 usd. 

So it's 35 usd. 

When the customer pays for the product the 35 usd. What happens next? 

And so If the production is 19 usd and the retail price is 30 that means I would earn 11? The 19usd goes straight to printify? And 11 to me? I'm just a little bit confused...

So I'm new to Printify and Shopify. Here's what happened:

I placed a real, live order for a mug on my site. I paid for shipping and of course the product including the retail price. 

The order of course then went to Printify but I had to pay for shipping again in Printify. :( I understand that I as the store owner placed an order so I'm paying for the shipping as a ""customer"", but in my Order total in Printify, the price I had to cover to have it produced was the Production Cost AND the Shipping Cost. 

I thought the Customer pays the shipping from Printify? Or in other words, the shipping cost I paid on the live site with Shopify I thought would cover the shipping cost that Printify wants?

I'm wondering if this is normal or is it because of my shipping profile in Shopify?

Hello everyone, I am going crazy with a problem related to prices and SKUs. I chose a provider and uploaded 200 wall art pieces connected to Etsy. The problem is that this provider has messed-up prices for different sizes (like an 11x14 costs less than an 8x10 and so on), and it seems the only way to change them is manually, because with Printify's bulk system you can update everything at once.

I added other sizes with another provider in draft listings that will need to be added by copying the SKUs into the published listings.

I have done LOTS of googling, but cannot confirm if I'm doing it right.

Right now I design the adult product in Printify, and ""publish"" to Etsy, and the listing shows up not problem.

Then I create the children's version in printify, but I don't publish, I just ""save as draft"".  When I do this, it generates all the SKUs for the variations.

I then follow instructions I found online for manually adding variations to an Etsy listing, using the generated SKUs.

But what I'm not sure of, and hoping someone on here can help with! Is do I need to ""publish"" that Children's listing in Printify, or will it be fine if someone orders one of the shirts since the SKUs are linked?

When I tried the variation I only have the colour one.

I placed a new order for those same three tees from a different provider on Printify, and it's been in production for about 12 hours (vs. the original cancelling provider was cancelling within an hour) so we'll see if it actually goes through....

I went back to some of my old products to compare the mockups that Printify generated a few weeks ago to what they're generating today, and they're night-and-day different.

UPDATE 7/31/24:  
I ordered some samples from Monster Digital via Printify last week & they arrive last night. B+C 3001 in Black - turned out great. Crisp knockouts, good halftones, no hazing. Looks better in person that in the photo - fabric is a great dark black (darker than the Gildan 5000 I also ordered) and colors really pop. Really happy with it, just can't use Printify's mockups in the listings.

Also opened a support ticket with Printify and sent them a bunch of samples & design files - they're looking into it but no word yet.

I'm experiencing a frustrating issue with Printify, and I'm hoping someone here can help.

When my clients place orders, I'm trying to request fulfillment through Printify, but the payment keeps getting declined. I've tried resubmitting the fulfillment request from different devices and using a private window. I also tried using a different card, but the same thing happened. I contacted my card company, and they confirmed there are no blocks on their end. Payments went through fine before and after this one.

To add to my frustration, not even an hour after encountering this issue, I purchased a premium plan from Printify, and the payment went through without any problems. I definitely have enough funds in my account, so that's not the issue.

It feels like I'm being forced to use Printify's balance feature as a workaround. I don't want to add money to the balance when my card should work directly.

Has anyone else experienced this problem? Any suggestions on how to resolve it? this is urgent since these fulfillments are crucial for my store's launch."

Hello everyone,

I have a lot of products already uploaded on Printify (wall art) which only have the measurements in inches. I wanted to ask:

1) Since Printify doesn’t have the standard European sizes (A4, A3, etc.), is it possible to use another manufacturer that has them and include them in the same listings along with those from Printify, or is there a simpler method? (Obviously, I want to keep Printify as a manufacturer because they have better prices).
2) If I only sell with measurements in inches, would I risk not having customers in Europe since the standard sizes used are A3, A4, etc.?"

As a seller here are the options you have got. *(Please add more in comments and I can add the valid ones in this list with due credits)*

1. **Create a full ecommerce site** on Shopify, Woocommerce, Bigcommerce and integrate Printify as fulfilment provider. This gives you more control over branding and SEO, but requires more setup and costs compared to the Pop-Up Store.
2. **Buy a custom domain and forward it** to your Printify store. Found this guy using a custom domain in his Instagram. https://www.instagram.com/exmorobo/. This is allows less customization for sure since your site is not on Shopify or Woo. However, the same link can be used as website address in future if you decide to move to a Shopify store. This in my opinion is wiser unless you are starting with huge budget. You can find cheap ways to get a domain name on Go Daddy, Link.Store, etc.

I am a new Etsy seller in the US, and I just received an order from Germany. I have only had 10 sales so far, and I had decided to think about international sales later and focus on domestic until my feet are wet. Apparently I didn't set that up that correctly. (If anybody can help me change this, I'd be very grateful.) 

On the order in Etsy, there's a note: ""You must share Etsy's IOSS number, \[XYZ\], with your courier for this order (use it only for this purpose). This helps ensure that your buyer won't be charged VAT twice. Make sure to write the value of this order in euros, on your package, too.""

On Printify, this item is ""on hold."" There's a ""submit"" button, but I am unsure if that's the next step or if I need to do something else first. 

My Etsy shop is obviously integrated with Printify. What do I need to do to keep this order moving? Printify will ship the item for me, so I am not working with my own courier. For the same reason, I am not able to write on the package! Since I just started selling two weeks ago, I haven't registered an LLC or anything that would make me exempt or have special status with this charge (if such a scenario even exists). 

Thanks for any help. I love designing, but I'm finding that new orders are actually stressing me out more than exciting me. I know this is the easier part of the POD model, but I am way more creative than I am business savvy. "

I was also told the publishing action doesn't reset for 24 hours, but mine times out after a few hours. I'm not sure support staff always know what's really going on, but at least I know this is affecting a lot of users now, as he just told me in the response. "

Seeking Advice: Printing Issues with Printify – Need Help from Experienced Designers,1,1do7cos,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1do7cos/seeking_advice_printing_issues_with_printify_need/,1,2024-06-25 21:28:22,"Hi everyone,

I'm facing some challenges with printing orders through Printify and could really use some advice from experienced designers or anyone familiar with custom printing processes.

I've been using Printify for my recent orders of posters and t-shirts, but I've encountered issues with the design sizes not matching the mockups as expected. Specifically, the designs are being centered or scaled down unexpectedly due to factors like the white background being detected as part of the design and the system's automatic scaling for different apparel sizes.

I've already reached out to Printify's support team, and while they've provided some insights, the current solutions don't fully meet my expectations for design placement and consistency across different shirt sizes.

Here are my main concerns:
- How can I ensure that my designs are printed accurately on the right chest area without unnecessary centering or scaling issues even if I take away the white background? 
- Is there a way to customize the print settings to maintain the intended size and placement more precisely?
- Should I consider handling the printing myself to have more control over the final product, and if so, what equipment or services would you recommend for DIY printing?

If anyone has experience with similar issues or can offer advice on alternative printing services or DIY solutions, I would greatly appreciate your insights. My goal is to deliver the best possible quality to my clients while navigating these printing challenges.

Thank you in advance for your help!"
Is there a way to make ministickers on one of the 6X6 kiss cut stickers?,1,1do4jw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1do4jw1/is_there_a_way_to_make_ministickers_on_one_of_the/,0,2024-06-25 19:15:59,"Every time i click on preview, no matter how large or small the sticker is, i am shown the entire sheet, like it's not a kiss cut sticker.

Cannot publish a product to WooCommerce multisite.

It's not a realistic request to disable these. I've checked all the settings and the initial connection creates an api key as expected.

  
How can I troubleshoot this? Printify support is just people referencing documentation. I just had someone try and tell me the publish was failing because my url (.co) did not match the examples (all .com). Anything requiring actual knowledge of web development goes to the offline technical team, and I have waited up to 2 months for a successful resolution / reply from them.

  
I wish I could just ditch Printify, but there aren't any better options and there's a big investment of time into this store.

Why plain text emails outperform fancy emails,0,1dmf4l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1dmf4l6/why_plain_text_emails_outperform_fancy_emails/,0,2024-06-23 12:38:58,"If you’re not sending out emails because you feel like you don’t have time. This post is for you. Sending out weekly newsletters can be a lot simpler than you think. Plain text emails are not only easier to create, but they also outperform fancy image-based emails most of the time.

I personally send out over 1000 email campaigns every year for various brands. The 1 email that brings in the most money for each brand, every year, is a plain text email. Forget your fancy black Friday email with gifs and HTML timers, my plain text email from the “CEO” will outperform that email every single time. I previously made a whole post about how to set this email up but, in a nutshell, it’s a heartfelt plain-text thank-you email that goes out sometimes during Q4. The real key is just being genuine.

Now I’ll explain 5 reasons why plain text emails outperform other emails most of the time.

1.      **Deliverability**

·        **Spam Filters**: Plain text emails are less likely to be flagged by spam filters compared to HTML emails, which often contain images, links, and various formatting elements that can trigger spam alerts.

·        **Inbox Placement**: Plain text emails are more likely to land directly in the recipient’s primary inbox rather than being relegated to the promotions or spam folders.

2.      **Makes you stand out**

·        **Outsmart your competition:** I can almost guarantee your competitors don’t regularly send out plain text emails. You can stand out by simply being different. Always remember, that great marketing has the perfect blend of creativity and simplicity. The combination of landing in the primary inbox, having a good subject line, and compelling copywriting can put you light years ahead of your competition. This leads me to my next point.

3.      **Compatibility and Readability**

·        **Simplicity**: Plain text emails have a clean and simple appearance, which can make them easier to read. The lack of distractions like images and flashy design elements helps recipients focus on the message content. Plain text emails are universally compatible with all customer's devices.

·        **Loading Speed**: Plain text emails load faster since they don't contain heavy images or complex HTML code, which is especially important for recipients with slow internet connections or limited data plans.

4.      **It's more personal**

·        **Personal Feel**: In plain text emails, it is your duty to just talk like people like they’re people. Don’t pretend to be someone else like “Sarah from customer service”. You are the CEO personally reaching out to your beloved customers. People will respect you for being transparent, this will ultimately improve your relationship with customers. People perceive plain text emails as more authentic and trustworthy compared to heavily designed emails that might look overly promotional.

5.      **Engagement metrics**

·        **Higher Open Rates**: Because they often look more like a personal email from a friend or colleague, plain text emails may achieve higher open rates. a good subject line can make a HUGE difference in open rates.

·        **Click-Through Rates**: With fewer distractions, the call-to-action in a plain text email can stand out more, potentially leading to higher click-through rates.

To wrap this up. The fancy emails are still good. They make you look legit, they are great for branding, and you can leverage media to build trust. I recommend still having a beautiful email template available, but there are large brands like Sticker Mule that ONLY send plain text emails and they are doing very well. They're probably pulling in more revenue from emails than most of their competitors. Moral of the story is don’t stress too much about always having perfect graphics. Your customers will appreciate a plain text email once in a while."

About 6” above the bottom hem of the shirt some of the adhesive and ink from the DTG print was smudged. It looks like they noticed it and attempted to scrape it off (you can still feel the adhesive) and thinned out the fabric enough to create a hole in the process. 

What the hell kind of quality control is this? Anyone know if this is common?"
Printify Image Quality Issue,1,1dikzqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1dikzqy/printify_image_quality_issue/,0,2024-06-18 14:39:55,"Hello there! I have a little problem...

I'm currently selling print versions of my art with the classic poster product on Printify, and recently had a order not go through to production because suddenly the image/product wasn't 'synced'. As I investigated further, I discovered it was because the image quality (dpi) wasn't high enough on some of the larger sizes.

This is strange as when I first created the listings, the image quality for all sizes was more than high enough. I even sent a few test products to friends and had orders come through of the sizes Printify is now claiming aren't high quality enough and all the pieces arrived beautifully clear and full of detail.

I've looked at every listing I have and it is an issue for every singIe one now 🫠

The images were taken with my Canon EOS M50 in RAW, edited in Lightroom and exported in highest quality. I obviously can try to re-export and see if it helps, but I was curious if this has happened to anyone here before, and if there is a way to fix it without having to re-upload the images completely!

Thank you!

So i am just starting my journey with printify and print on demand in general. I have my own store with shopify. My question here (and I believe this must confuse a lot of people), is about taxes. So I live in Portugal, Europe.  My target costumers will be mainly the US, but my store will be available to sell international. Which tax system do i need to follow? The US taxes, the European VAT system or both?

And to add a little more of confusion to the topic, what if the printify provider is from China? The produt is made in China or another country outside of the US/Europe, does the tax system stays the same?

I have been watching some videos of people explaning and the more I watch, the more confused I get....

  
And as a starter, do I need to already have a VAT ID or whatever? I believe the Portuguese threshold is 10k€/year, but if you know, please correct if I'm wrong.

  
Thanks in advance."

I have never seen these options with printify. I have been doing this for about 4 months now. I am just wondering what the best POD service would be that offers bundling and more variation offers? An example I saw was cell phone cases. In the store you were able to choose from iPhone or Samsung on the same listing. Printify, each image has to have its own listing and you can choose variations of iPhone covers but you can not add Samsung covers to the same listing. Thank you in advance. "

So, if our Etsy store is priced in GBP, and we’ve set our billing prefs on Printify to GBP - we ignore the selling (retail) price saying USD and just put in the amount we want it to sell for in GBP and it will publish in that right? So 8.99 “USD” it’ll be £8.99 in the store? 

What about the other costs? Production, etc.? That gets auto converted to GBP because we set our billing to it, so we ignore it says USD there too? Is that for sure? "

HQ image showing as blurry in design editor,1,1dgsdsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1dgsdsd/hq_image_showing_as_blurry_in_design_editor/,1,2024-06-16 04:42:30,"Hi there!

I'm hoping someone can help me figure out what is happening here. When I zoom into my images in the Printify editor while creating a product, in this case posters, they are blurry. I've created 5 different listings, all of which come in 7 different dimensions. I have used multiple version of the files, for example I've made 7 different files of each image to match the dimensions of each version. No matter what version of the image I'm using, it's blurry. I'm linking a section of an image below, versus what Printify shows. The image I created is a 300 DPI image. When it is scaled to fit the Printify dimensions it goes up to 552 DPI (according to the editor at least).

The files I'm using are all jpeg format if that helps. I did try saving the file as a PNG instead and it seems to have marginally increased the quality showing in the editor but it is still not near the actual image quality I'm uploading. Just to clarify because my google search results seem to mostly focus on mockups being blurry. This is the actual product layout editor I'm having the issue with.

Any insight into why this is happening would be appreciated.

Then after trying to change the payment method few times my account got suspended and I contacted the support and they unlocked it but the problem is still happening and I am too scared to try and change the payment card again because it the account might be suspended.

Help with withheld taxes and sales taxes,5,1dettqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1dettqp/help_with_withheld_taxes_and_sales_taxes/,2,2024-06-13 15:12:52,"Hi, I am new to Printify but I've been using other POD services for years.

I've just set up a pop up store and while reviewing all the settings, I saw that there's a 30% tax being withheld from my payouts. 

I contacted the support center about it and they came up with a generic answer, but when I started digging deeper, they changed the reason for that 30%.

Originally, they said they'd withhold that amount and send it to the tax services of my country (Switzerland) because I am required to pay taxes on my sales. I told them that didn't make sense because Switzerland does not tax revenue that high, and what would happen with the surplus?

They then changed their answer and said that 30% is actually sent to the IRS in the States... What? So, I need to pay revenue taxes in the states even though I live in Europe and sell internationally? If that's the case, I am being taxed twice on the same revenue, once in the US and once here. What's left of my profit then?

Also, my store is just to give my followers a way to support me (I am a musician). I sell maybe 100$ worth of profit by year... I am not making millions here.

Is there a threshold that activates that 30% tax? Meaning, does that tax only come into play if I sell for more than a specific amount of $ throughout the year, or do I have to pay it only if I've made a couple bucks?

Now about the sales tax : I read online that, for example in Kentucky, I need to sell for 100k or more (or 200 transactions) before I need to comply with the sales tax laws but that changes state by state. Since I will never sell for that amount, is there a way to avoid that tax?

Thanks! "

Today, I setup an Etsy page and successfully linked my Printify account to it.

However, when I look at my Etsy page, it only has the one item that it made me create in order to start the store.

I was always under the impression that the work that I did on the Printify site would automatically transfer to the Etsy page as soon as the two were linked, which it now is.

Do I need to wait a little longer (it's only been about 4 hours since I did this) or is this not something that can happen between the two sites and I need to list all 48 items again on the Etsy site?

When I'm using the Printify API, under certain circumstances I get an error when updating a product listing witth new images for certain colors (variants); it worked for 3 products; it failed for 3 others. If anybody has suggestions, please let me know - I appreciate it!

PROBLEM:

When I try to update product using 'requests.put(url, headers, json=payload)', I get the following error for 3 products; it works on 3 others. The script updates a product listing by assigning different images to certain colors in the product listing

Error updating product 66620fb2a7ecae7218074d37: 400 - {""status"":""error"",""code"":8253,""message"":""Operation failed."",""errors"":{""reason"":""Provided images do not exist"",""code"":8253}}

The error says: """"Provided images do not exist"" - but of course, the image (s) exist in the Printify Media Library

I tried this with 6 products ( blueprint id's: 12, 706, 710, 77, 49, 1296; Print Provider ID: 39) - it works on 3 of them (blueprint id's: 706, 710, 1296; Print Provider id: 39) and fails on the other 3 (blueprint id's: 12, 77, 49; Print Provider id: 39). The only difference between the products that I can see is that on the products that it failed, there were 3-5 print area positions ( front, back, left\_sleeve, neck, etc..); and on the ones that it succeeded, there were only 2 available print positions ( front, back) - but, that shouldn't matter because in all the cases, I just updated the position = ""front""

The payload is the same in all of the cases (except the variant id's that were updated - essentially: 3-5 sets of variant ID's, representing a specified color gets a new image, which is uploaded into the Media Library before hand

The url used for the request is:  {base\_url}shops/{SHOP\_ID}/products/{product\_id}.json'

The headers used is: headers = {

'Authorization': f'Bearer {PRINTIFY\_API\_KEY}',

How to double your revenue from email campaigns ,5,1dbm9us,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1dbm9us/how_to_double_your_revenue_from_email_campaigns/,8,2024-06-09 12:25:05,"This post is all about deliverability. The basic math equation is simple. More people will buy from your emails if more people see your emails. So if your open rates are below 20%, you can probably double them by just following the basic tips I give you below.

With that being said, let's get started.

Here are 10 things you should avoid doing regularly if you want to have good deliverability:

1. Don’t keep unengaged members on your email list. If your business isn't seasonal and someone hasn't opened your emails in over 6 months you should consider either reducing the volume of emails that are sent to them or completely removing them from your email list. They will bring your open rates down and this will increase your chances of being marketed as spam.

1. Break your list down. Segmentation does not matter if you have less than 2k emails. But once you get to 10k+ emails You’ll need these 4 basic segments: Buyers, Non-buyer, Engaged customers, and Non-engaged customers. You can personalize emails based on what they have bought/viewed. This alone will significantly boost your open rates. Think of it like this, what’s more likely to be opened? FREE SHIPPING on everything Today Only OR You’re in luck🎲 – Free Shipping for the next 6 hours in {{Users\_city}} (while recommending items that they have viewed recently in the email)

1. Beware of spam filters - Did you know that you could get blacklisted? If your domain is unhealthy your emails will almost always go directly to spam. It's almost impossible to revive a domain so be careful how you go about sending from your main domain. Also if you burnt a domain in the past from 1 IP address it's likely that if you create a new domain using that same IP address your 2nd domain also will be negatively affected. If you use a shifty email sending provider you will also run into spam filter problems.

1. Write a good subject line. The subject line is the single most important aspect of email copywriting. There are typically only 2 types of good subject lines. Subject lines to make people curious and subject lines that are direct (Typically with a good offer). That’s literally all there is to it. Also, don't lead with a misleading subject line. Pissing people off is the easiest way to get spam complaints instead of normal unsubscribes. (Spam complaints are way worse for deliverability)

1. Don't be inconsistent. Algorithms love consistency. This is why the number 1 way to boost engagement on almost any social platform ever created is to post consistently and follow some sort of routine. Emails aren't different at all. Try to email your most engaged segment every week. This will give you a good average open rate and also it will show the email service provider that people interact with your content regularly.

1. Don't try to hide the unsubscribe button. Not having an unsubscribe button is illegal but some people just try to use cheat codes like making the unsubscribe text white on a white background. This is the easiest way to increase spam complaints greatly. Customers should never feel like you're forcing them to do anything.

1. Don't send emails from shady domains. You should have a clear professional-looking sender address. Use a business domain, not a regular email account. Avoid using any random characters anywhere in the domain and do everything you can to make it very clear where the email is coming from.

1. Make sure your grammar is on point. Typos of any kind can be a red flag for spam filters. It's impossible to be perfect all the time but at least try to make sure your emails have less typos than this Reddit post.

1. Never buy email lists and use them for B2C marketing. Sending to people without their consent is the worst thing that you could possibly do if you're trying to avoid the spam filter. Make sure every single email address that is receiving your emails has opted in.

1. Don't use spammy copywriting. Most people have literally no idea what this means so I put together a list of things that are generally bad. Here is the list of things to avoid: Using all caps for subject lines, capitalizing every word in your subject lines all the time, using large fonts, using fonts smaller than size 8 font in main bodies of sales copy, overusing words like FREE or SALE in your subject lines and over using emojis.

I want to end this with a reminder that no one is above spam filters. If you go to your spam folder right now you'll probably see at least one 8 figure company stuck in there multiple times. These people hire ""experts"" and pay them thousands every month and still can't figure it out. So just because your emails are doing okay now, just know that can change fast if you are not careful."
Looking for the Best Printify Providers for Shirts in 2024 for Shipping to Europe,0,1dbdw5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1dbdw5g/looking_for_the_best_printify_providers_for/,0,2024-06-09 04:57:37,"Hey everyone,

I’m planning to start a new line of custom shirts and I’m looking for recommendations on the best Printify providers that offer high-quality printing and reliable shipping to Europe. My main considerations are:

Quality of the shirts: I want to ensure that the material and print quality are top-notch.  


Customer feedback: Providers with positive reviews and high customer satisfaction.  
  
Cost of production: Competitive pricing for high-quality products.  
  
Cost of shipping: Reasonable shipping costs within Europe.  
  
Printing quality: Consistently good print results that withstand washing and wear.

I’ve heard about a few providers like T-shirt & Sons, Shirtee, Tpop, and OPT OnDemand, but I’m not sure which one is the best fit for my needs. If you have experience with any of these or other providers on Printify, I would love to hear your thoughts and recommendations.

Thanks in advance!"
Listing on amazon and then manually ordering from printify ,0,1db8hqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1db8hqq/listing_on_amazon_and_then_manually_ordering_from/,4,2024-06-09 00:48:06,"I am in the process of starting a dropshipping print on demand business, however, I have hit a roadblock. My plan of action is to list products on amazon, when someone orders it I will manually place the order on Printify. But amazon has its shipping label which it says needs to be printed for the product and I am assuming that printify print providers will have their own label.  So, if someone orders from amazon and I put a manual order on printify, there will be a shipping label mismatch. 

Can i send the amazon shipping label to the print provider?  
How do i go about this problem? 

I really need help. Thanks."

I recently created designs on journals for Printify and am not overly satisfied with their product. Trying to see it from a customers perspective, if I ordered this product from someone I would never buy from them again and know I can buy better quality from a $2 shop. With one journal, the first two pages were partly stuck to the inside cover. I complained and they sent me another, but am still not happy at all with the quality. Seems poorly made to me. I printed on the blank, case binding journals. Anyone else had issues? This doesn’t give me confidence with their other products now, so I’m considering ditching the whole thing, even though I’ve paid for listings on Etsy. "
How long does it take Printify to charge your card after an Etsy order through the integration?,1,1da1xel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1da1xel/how_long_does_it_take_printify_to_charge_your/,2,2024-06-07 11:16:07,"How long does it take for Printify to charge your card on file when someone buys through Etsy? 

-I have a card on file, it's functional, I use it all the time for manual and sample orders.

-My Etsy listing is set up through the Printify integration.

-The funds show up as paid in my Etsy account, so I know it's paid on the buyer's end.

-I see no transaction for charging my card in Printify and the order hasn't been created yet, either. But I also don't have any notices of anything being on hold. It's like the order doesn't even exist.

-It's been almost 4 hours. I read that the charge to my card should happen within 2 hours.

For clarity, this isn't a post asking if Etsy payments will transfer to Printify. I know that Printify charges my card, I'm just asking about the automated process where an Etsy purchase is supposed to trigger the order in Printify and I'm supposed to get charged by Printify. I'm not sure if it's a glitch or if it's normal. I don't want to waste a day waiting to find out it didn't trigger the order since it has to be shipped by Tuesday.

Is this wait time normal?"

How To Fix Errors in Publishing Mock-Ups from Printify to Woocommerce Media.,2,1d9gq5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1d9gq5c/how_to_fix_errors_in_publishing_mockups_from/,9,2024-06-06 19:14:47,"This is for all those who are having trouble with mock ups being published to their woocommerce store. It's very simple.

For more than a month I had problems with Printify Mock Ups in my website. Either, the wrong mock up got published, or the preview thumnail that showed up was the wrong one, thus it was confusing. I wrote to Printify several times and they always said they will get back in 48 hours, but they never did. A couple of days back, I even made a post here and some of you tried to help me.

Today I reached out to them before making the final call to close my printify account and shift to another POD provider as a last attempt. To my surprise, they gave me a very simple solution.

1. Open a private window and login to your printify account and wo0commerce account and then publish the product again. 

Or

2. Publish from a different browser.

Or

3. Clear your cache and cookies in your existing browser and try.

I tried from publishing from a different browser which was Google chrome. Earlier I used Firefox.

I am glad to say that it worked and I am finally able to publish the products like I wanted.

It was a very simple fix.

Hope you found it helpful."

Wandering the Wilderness of Global Taxation: A UK-Based Inquiry,1,1d9dzv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1d9dzv4/wandering_the_wilderness_of_global_taxation_a/,0,2024-06-06 16:20:37,"Hello, I have a few questions about taxes.

# 

My scenario:



* I live in the UK

* I intend to ship to the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Europe.

* A manufacturer from the UK will be used to ship to both the UK and Europe.

* A manufacturer from Australia will be used to ship to both Australia and New Zealand.

* Manufacturers from the US and Canada will be used to ship to their respective countries.



Questions:



* Income Tax:
   * How can I ensure I only pay taxes on profit and not revenue earnings?

* Import Taxes:
   * Is there a way for my European customers not to pay for this apart from me using a European Manufacturer (instead of UK manufacturer)?

* Canadian Taxes:
   * What steps do I need to take?
   * Can I claim Canadian taxes back?
   * Will Canada require me to pay taxes on shipping?
   * Can Canadian taxes on shipping be claimed back(if they exist)?



* USA taxes:
   * Do US states charge a tax on shipping?
   * As a UK citizen, can I claim taxes back on both product and shipping(if taxes for shipping exist) ?
      * How can I do this?



* UK taxes
   * I pay the VAT tax when paying the manufacturer, right? And my clients also pay VAT when purchasing my product, right? And Etsy takes care of customer paid taxes, right?
   * Can I claim back all business-related taxes that I pay?
   * What if I use my UK manufacturer to ship to Europe as well? Can I get those taxes back?
      * If yes, is there a different procedure for that?

* Australia:
   * Australia is not mentioned in the Printify section about taxes. Do I need to pay taxes for products manufactured in Australia?
   * Can this tax be claimed back if I live in the UK?
   * Does Australia have any taxes on shipping and can it be claimed back as well?
   * Even when shipping to New Zealand?

New Zealand:

* Do my New Zealand customers have to pay import taxes for products shipping from Australia?
   * Can this be avoided?

* Can I claim back taxes paid to Australian manufacturers for products shipped to New Zealand?



  
Also, when applicable, is the tax on shipping paid by each customer at the checkout or by me at the moment of purchase at the printify side? Is it included in the price?

Which Printify model on Comfort Colors 1717 mockups are the most accurate? ,2,1d6q3zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1d6q3zc/which_printify_model_on_comfort_colors_1717/,2,2024-06-03 06:09:03,"Each model on the mockups shown with my designs seem to look totally different. The first one (white male) looks one way, but the first woman with the shirt on looks like the design is much larger. It makes it really hard to understand how exactly the shirt will look like on a person. Anyone else have this problem? I thought the design I had looked relatively large when I saw it on the mockups (used the white male as the guide), but when I ordered one, it was quite a bit smaller (looking more like the 3rd woman who has her hip out a bit).

Wich is why my other option is using Printify and their Eco-collection (sadly the items I want to use are partially out of stock). So basically I'm just wondering if teemill is worth it and if people have a good experience using it (especially for print on demand and connecting it with an Etsy store). Is the quality good?

2. Who can collect the taxes (sales tax, CA GST, EU VAT, AU/NZ GST, etc.) on BigCommerce's side, as those are already included in Printify's end. What will happen is a double taxation on my part.

2.5 million in sales while paid ads are turned off,27,1d0uu8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1d0uu8q/25_million_in_sales_while_paid_ads_are_turned_off/,11,2024-05-26 12:57:43,"Before I get into the good parts of this post here's a quick disclaimer:  
- This brand did 1.8 million the year before  
- I do not own this brand, I was hired to build a cult-following  
- paid ads were being ran for the first quarter of the year but not converting well

That's relevant information because not every brand can see massive success without paid ads. Most of the things I talk about in this post are pretty much useless if you do under 15k/month. Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about what I did to nearly double this brand's revenue without dumping more money into ads.

**For those who don't like reading, I'll summarize what I did right here: I built a community around the brand.**

So I'll break down what I did into 5 steps:

1. Obtained a shit load of user-generated content

I was able to get 300 videos of people using the brand's products in under 60 days.  
This is easier than it seems. People pay influencers thousands to pose with their products. For a brand with a bit of traction, the value in user-generated content is to get products in front of a larger audience; Not necessarily for social proof (like it is for smaller brands). So with that being said, don't spend a lot of money on UGC content unless it's for a promotional post on a page with a large following.

Don't fixate on having the prettiest videos. Give a wide variety of people the opportunity to submit content.

3 ways you can get user-generated content for free/cheap are:

- Use your social media channels to offer a free product in exchange for a video review  
- Setup a review email flow, offer existing customers a chance at a full refund for a video testimonial that meets certain criteria  
- Directly contact influencers and negotiate/hire someone with a network of influencers to do the negotiation process for you

2. Created a blog

I designed a blog page on the website and posted on it 1-2 times per week. I used Ai to generate in-season ideas for blog posts, then got my copywriter to do some research and come up with short blog posts that were informative and read well. P.S Just using chatgpt to pump out blog content can work but the content will never be as engaging as content written by a real person that understands the marketing angle. We also tried to add user-generated content on the blog pages as much as we could.

This is by far the easiest way to get people back onto your site without them feeling like you're trying to sell them more products. This is the base of the next 3 steps. Good blog content makes people in your niche excited to hear from you. This will boost your email open rates, allow you to post in groups that are heavily moderated against promotions, and give you a lot of niche-specific copywriting to work with.

3. Created a subreddit (or any type of group)

I created a subreddit for this brand, then I spent hours finding niche-relevant content. Then, I queued a whole bunch of posts. I did a mix of reposting content from tiktok, instagram, youtube, etc, and posting the site's blog posts and UGC content. Growing the community was tricky but once I got some momentum going it was almost growing itself.

There's major upside to owning a community inside of your niche. You can block your competitors from posting in your sub and post as much promotional content as you want. You can also mix content, so people have no idea if you're promoting a store, sharing a funny photo, or giving a useful recommendation. You'd honestly be shocked by the amount of traffic our weekly pinned post brought to the site.

4. Discord community

I used social media, Reddit, and emails to grow the community to 11 thousand members in under a year. Customers were giving design ideas, connecting with store employees, and volunteering to send content with products for FREE.

This is like a reddit community but more personal. The main difference between the discord and the reddit is that the discord is branded and the Reddit is just niche specific. This is a good place to run competitions and polls, and also just interact with customers on a personal level. You can get a tone of UGC from a discord community if you use it right.

5. Email and SMS marketing

I saved the best for last. Normally my posts are mainly focused on emails but I thought I'd switch it up today to truly convey what goes on behind the scenes of well-coordinated email/sms marketing.  
Think of emails as an ongoing conversation between you and your customer. You play the role of a friend recommending things to a peer. You already know things about them, like their interests, location, and buying habits. Now use segmentation and predictive analytics to make sure relevant content gets sent to interested people. I'll leave it at that.

But before I leave I'll share some more info about this brand that may be relevant. It's a breed-specific animal brand, this brand has been around for about 4 years and has consistently grown 30-40% each year with last year being an outlier (almost doubled sales), the people in this niche are extremely passionate about their pets so this may have made it easier for me to grow a community this quickly, and the 2.5 million that I am attributing to my systems are just the sales that came from EMAIL and SMS marketing.  
Thanks so much for taking the time to read my post, Id be happy to provide more clarity on any of the subjects that I mentioned in this post."

Bulk Order Discount,3,1d0259l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1d0259l/bulk_order_discount/,3,2024-05-25 09:44:00,"Does the bulk order discount get triggered if the person purchases through Shopify? Still fairly new to this and just started offering custom designs for small businesses to get my name out there. 

Backstory: I have a local company that wants to purchase 60+ custom design shirts for marketing and I’m getting them printed with the design I made for them. I know Printify has a bulk order discount so my question is….how do I process this? The way I see it is I can:

1) put it directly through Printify in the bulk order section so I get the discount and reflect that in their markup. But then how do I record my payment from the buyer? 
2) put it in my shop, create a discount for them (reflecting the bulk order discount I get) and let them order it on Shopify so it records their payment and sends the order to Printify…but does it trigger the bulk order discount in Printify through Shopify?

Thanks in advance, I hope that makes sense lol"

I'm on selling on Etsy, but I suppose bookkeeping is going to be similar across platforms, just different fees.  I checked out QuickBooks and it was a bit much for my little Etsy shop.  I looked at the YouTuber Cassiy Johnson's excel spreadsheet and it was a bit confusing from the get-go because I sell various products, not just one style of T-shirt with different designs. I sell mugs, shirts, blankets, tumblers, bags, etc. So her spreadsheet is not set up for that. I just looked at my bank account from April 1-April 30th and just took my Etsy earnings minus my Printify (inventory) expenses and I'm barely breaking even. 

Then I look at May 1 to today (17 May 2024), and I'm at a profit loss, but I do have some orders in my Etsy payment account that are in reserve. It looks like I'm not charging enough, but I really want to be sure before I set my store to vacation mode while I refigure out all of the pricing. Is there a better way to do this? 

I think I'm having such a hard time because with each product, there is a variation, even the colors, type of shipping speed, plus the free shipping over $35 on Etsy, promo code use, etc. to take into account. There's not a one-size fits all solution for so many different products, all with so many variants and different shipping speeds. 

Every few days, I am flipping back and forth between the Etsy screen to Printify screen then finally to my bank account trying to figure it all out and I then I look at the payment hold and payment reserves in Etsy trying to figure out if that's my profit or not and just get really confused and push it off for another time. 

There's got to be a simpler way to do this! "

I started my Etsy store a few days ago and just made my first sale. I was so hopped up on trying to get a sale that I didn't fully understand what to do after that.

Printify is connected to my Etsy store. The order was placed on Etsy and now I just ... wait? 

I'm confused about what happens with payment. Does Printify charge me for the items and then refund me the amount leaving me with the profit? I've been reading about this process, but I admit I'm a little confused still. 

Thanks for anyone who can help."

This is the first time I have tried this with WC. Now my husband is a web designer by profession and has built many WC shops but they are by installing the plugin and building the site around Salient for WP. He does not just have a WP site that houses just WC if that makes sense. They are websites that WC  is added into.

So we have been having problems getting Printify to work on our test site. I finally figured out that its the URL that is wrong so I fixed that because he uses his own URLS that he sets.  
So when you make the products and they go to your WC how do you organize them on the site in categories etc?  
Could anyone post links to their site that uses printify so I can see how it looks maybe?"

I made one on the Gildan5000 with printify choice as the manufacturer. After receiving my shirt, the design is slightly off center and crooked, despite being perfectly centered and straight on the website. 

Has anyone else had similar issues with printify choice and/or the Gildan5000. I assume the issue is with printify choice and not the specific shirt I use but not positive… Since this is my first order, I’m curious if I just got unlucky with this specific order, or if all subsequent orders will be off center and crooked as well. 

Anyone have similar experiences? I ordered another shirt using Next Level 3600 and a different manufacturer. Eager to see how that one turns out.

How Do You Guys Handle Stock Status Updates in Etsy? Pros & Cons?  ,1,1cmsmed,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1cmsmed/how_do_you_guys_handle_stock_status_updates_in/,8,2024-05-08 08:34:54,"I'm relatively new to this POD thing, so sorry if you all find this question stupid.  But, I just realized that Printify doesn't automatically update stock status in Etsy.  

From what I can gather, there are two ways to deal with this. 

1) sync published products in bulk within Printify by ""publishing"" already-published products, and only ticking the  ""colors, sizes, prices and SKUs"" option.  

2) Don't let Printify give a stock status to Etsy at all to begin with, and if a sale comes through for a product that's out of stock, contact buyer and see if they're ok with a delay

Is that my only two options here?  Am I missing something?

What are the pros and cons of each?  

I assume that if I go with option 1, then I need to manually refresh/sync this stuff daily just to keep everything as updated as possibly in the Etsy store.  If I go with option 2, I don't have to refresh/sync daily, but then I get to deal with the one-offs when someone purchases something that's out of stock.

My thinking is option 1 is the less crappy one.  Am I right?  If so, why?  If not, why?

Also, is this some sort of Printify issue? Is my being on the Printify platform making it easier for these crooks to steal my work? It's almost like they have access to the design file or something, I mean they don't even take time to remove my website's name from their T-Shirts.

Should I send a .svg (inkscape) file for print to print me in the nature dimensions?,0,1cfiewq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1cfiewq/should_i_send_a_svg_inkscape_file_for_print_to/,0,2024-04-29 04:59:42,"The dimension of the whole ""portal"" or door decoration is 105x48in (150DPI), but every part of the door have their own dimensions (like pillar or semicircle). I want to import some .png file into inkscape to scale into the nature dimensions and that a printer guy can print every part of the door in a very good quality and the nature dimensions. Should I sent it into .svg format or I have to choose another format? I've reportedly heard that I cannot send the file into .svg format, but I have to choose other format like .eps, .pdf or .png; is that true? Would printer guys open .svg file into inkscape or another svg softwares (like Adobe Illustrator) to print any part of the door? How would they print semicircle if printers print in square shape? This shapes on the image is just a sketch. I will edit and design it later.

Canvas Design preview is showing lines and is not sharp and can't figure out why.,0,1cf938v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1cf938v/canvas_design_preview_is_showing_lines_and_is_not/,3,2024-04-28 22:31:11,"Hi,

  
I have upscaled the image and the size is as follows:  
6000 x 4800  9.5MB 600 DPI 32 bit

When I put this in printify and look at the preview of the design, the image looks like its to  stretched out to much for the canvas.  I've tried a few different sizes of canvas and it looks the same on every design.  I'm planning on selling these and want a good product and sharp design.  I'm not sure if this is just a printify issue or if I need to try to upscale differently.  

Has anyone else seen this or know of a possible solution?

I started an eBay store months ago, published 1 item and it said I was already at 69/70 items published for the month. I was confused and just didn't do anything with the store for a while. I tried to get my eBay store going again by getting a limit increase which allowed me to post 120 items for the month. It was at 0/120, then I published ONE SINGLE LISTING (a t-shirt) then it tells me I'm already at only 1 listing left that I can publish. I don't understand what is taking up all my listing slots? It says something about keeping the variants low, but the shirts I publish only come in one color and they come in sizes S-3XL, which would only be 6 variants total (maybe 7 if you count the only color (black) as a variant). When I try to publish another listing from Printify it tells me that I'm already at the limit and can't publish anymore. My eBay store only has 3 listings up on it right now. I've never made a sale on that shop either obviously. I just don't know what to do, I want to list items but my limit gets maxed out whenever I post just one singular item."

Quality of Shirt Prints,3,1cd662b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1cd662b/quality_of_shirt_prints/,10,2024-04-26 06:28:15,"So for my tshirts, I went with a supplier with a 
9.6 star rating - 
UNDERGROUND THREADS - By NEXT LEVEL. 
A friend bought one, said they looked great, threw it in the WASH, followed the tshirt instructions, cold water, tshirt inside out to protect the graphic - hung to dry. 

It was its first wash, and when it came out, pieces of the graphic were cracking / falling off. 

It currently looks like it's a decade old. 

I know I can get a refund or replacement for my friend, but my biggest concern is this happening to another customer, and how do I even discern what other supplier to go with when a 9.6 out of 10 is *this* poor in quality?

T Shirt and Sons questionable print quality and smudging,1,1cb46mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1cb46mx/t_shirt_and_sons_questionable_print_quality_and/,6,2024-04-23 20:07:34,"I ordered a sample (manual order) Lane Seven LS14001 Black / L hoodie printed by T Shirt and Sons around 2 weeks ago. Once the hoodie arrived I was quite disappointed with the print quality.

# Paint/print

First off the print/paint looks like it was painted on with a paintbrush. It's hard to describe but I have a hoodie I own with a similar size white print on it and there the paint is sturdy, solid and raised above the fabric whereas the Printify hoodie looks like it was painted deep into the fabric.

Here are some pictures of a retail hoodie I got from an irl store:

[Here the paint looks solid and is raised on top of the fabric](https://preview.redd.it/4dwceyki48wc1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=41da67a8ffd8db6a89856de45572fd0b8e8da5fe)

Now here's a photo with both side by side:

[Paint on the left frankly looks like it was painted on with a paintbrush whilst the right side looks like a normal print you would find on everyday hoodies or t-shirts](https://preview.redd.it/050a99zx48wc1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dc60cd22cce1b71e22fe08c24836620cf74d77c)

Also the black fabric sticks out from underneath the paint but it's hard to get it to show on camera.

# Smudging

There is also significant smudging of the print. Here's another picture where it's more obvious:

[Smudging of the print highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/9wmkzvm168wc1.png?width=2096&format=png&auto=webp&s=e794b6238e29060fe8f87a9daef7cdd55f4270fe)

I don't think the smudging is a result of blurriness from my upload because I uploaded my design as an svg. I am also scared to wash the hoodie fearing it might smear the paint even more or maybe the whole design will wash off, who knows.

Is this print quality to be expected with print on demand? I definitely wouldn't want to sell any designs if the print quality is like this. Frankly I would be embarrassed to sell merch or any kind artwork with this quality of print.

Edit: I submitted a request for a reprint and it got approved super fast (15 mins). Will update this thread once the replacement arrives.

Update: The order came very fast, replacement order was created 24th Apr 12:45 PM and arrived on the 26th which is genuinely impressive. The bad news is that the replacement still has the same issue of fabric sticking out through the paint. I have messaged support again about the issue and will update further

Last update: After messaging support I said if TSS can't print properly then just give me a refund and they did. I'd like to add that Printify support was amazing through this whole process, the site is very nice and easy to use, it's just a shame that some print providers have such poor quality. I have attached some pictures of the reprint:

https://preview.redd.it/guqqrwaog8xc1.jpg?width=1512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c879a6ebcf555cb6b3f95a17603b60400c3dfee9

The holes/fibres or whatever they are, create such an awful grainy look on white or any colour text that I would be embarrassed to sell this type of quality print. Mind you this is my first experience with POD but this genuinely doesn't look like the quality of print that I've seen in YouTube videos of POD samples. Anyway I'm going to try a different print provider and see how that goes."

So far I've only ordered 1 sample that I haven't received, but I did so with an image I had converted to CMYK profile. 

I don't like the way the image itself looks in CMYK. The colors are dark and muted. I hoped maybe the sample would look different in a surprisingly BETTER than the mockup way. Can anyone give me advice on this? I don't have a lot of money to spend on samples and I don't want to upload images for mockups and product listings that are making things harder or worse for me to make adjustments so that photos and final product appear similar enough to be a non-issue for customers.

Confused About Shipping Proceeds,1,1can4lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1can4lj/confused_about_shipping_proceeds/,12,2024-04-23 04:49:21,"\-Sold a item on Etsy for retail price of $28.50 

\-Customer paid an additional $7 for shipping. Order total is now $35.49

\-My TOTAL profit on Etsy is $28.50 for that specific sale

&#x200B;

On the printify site, it says my production cost was $16.79 + $7 to ship, Total being $23.79

&#x200B;

So...my profit was $28.50 (etsy) - $23.79 (printify) = $4.71

&#x200B;

If my customer paid for shipping (that was synced to Etsy via printify), why did I not keep the shipping fee as profit in my Etsy store? Where did the shipping Etsy fee go, because printify still had me pay the $7 shipping. In summary, the shipping fee my Etsy customer paid seems to have vanished and I was still required to pay shipping in my printify account.

&#x200B;

I thought the shipping fee my Etsy customer paid rolled over into printify. Where the heck did it go?!

Id appreciate any advice. I am a little confused about the process.

Exact Position for Left Chest Logo Placement + Print Quality,2,1c7ia07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1c7ia07/exact_position_for_left_chest_logo_placement/,2,2024-04-19 06:39:13,"Does anyone know how or have the exact position measurements for a left chest logo or graphic? I cannot get the placement right. I’ve tried on three different samples. It’s either too low or to far right.

Also, I’ve tried both Printify and Printful. Same issue. I also found that the Bella + Canvas sample I ordered from Printful is about an inch or so shorter in length than that of ShiftPod. However, the ShiftPod print quality Is much better. 

Your help is appreciated. Thank you!"

I'm also always on the lookout for places to print battlemaps as well and decided to give this site a try

Delayed Fulfillment from SwiftPOD,1,1c3kaqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1c3kaqy/delayed_fulfillment_from_swiftpod/,17,2024-04-14 10:49:18,"I'm a new POD shop and have had a couple of dozen sales so far.  But my early and limited experience with SwiftPOD has me feeling very uneasy.  There has been more than one issue with my 50 sales so far concerning SwiftPOD.  And here is my latest, a single tshirt ordered on the 11th, originally estimated to ship on the 13th, now estimated to ship on the 16th.

https://preview.redd.it/je7tv4tg9duc1.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=33037594aa61680f3e607b6ec9f8cc614e408308

I assumed some people choose a provider based on turn around speed.  And SwiftPOD is advertised at an average of 1.9 days.  Well, 5 days is more than 2x the average.  And this isn't the first time.  


I understand there are reasons - but it would be VERY helpful if shop owners had access to those reasons.  Is it the color, the garment, the weather?  Seriously - why can't we be informed as to why an order is being drastically delayed?  


And when I try to reach SwitftPOD direct, I am routed back to Printify.  And unfortunately, my experience with Printify is ZERO assistance in solving the problem.  Being told to wait until the date SWIFTPOD claims delivery doesn't solve the problem of why this is consistently happening.  I'd say I've got a 10% poor experience so far.  That's horrible!  


This post is not to be a baseless rant.  If the issue is offering a color that is causing these issues - I will remove it from the shop.  Or if the design is a PIA to print.  I will remove it.  But not sharing what the problem is and giving shop owners the ability to make an executive decision is just nuts.  


And for those who suggest switching from SwiftPOD to someone else, there are not any other vendors that offer sleeve printing and/or the volume of colors Swift does.  But maybe that will need to be done to address the issues and that is a massive amount of work to redo every item again to simply dump an unreliable fulfillment center.  If my entire apparel shop has to go through that process, I would probably consider trying Printful.  


Does anyone have any experience with these kinds of issues that perhaps you could offer some insight into how to deal with this?"
