Good news for Printful sellers in the UK and Canada!,1,1gbtfww,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1gbtfww/good_news_for_printful_sellers_in_the_uk_and/,0,2024-10-25 19:48:41,"Hi, everyone! 👋 

We're happy to introduce our improved Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) shipping option! 

With DDP, you can now include customs duties and taxes in the shipping rate for international orders, giving your customers the convenience of covering these fees upfront. This means smoother, hassle-free deliveries! 📦✨

Currently, DDP is available for international orders shipped to **Canada** and the **UK**, and it’s accessible to sellers who have live shipping rates enabled in their stores. However, the availability and cost of DDP may vary depending on the order details and shipping destination.

You can learn more about DDP in this FAQ ➡️ [https://bit.ly/3Y9S7ew](https://bit.ly/3Y9S7ew)  

Additionally, we'd like to remind you that when choosing which products to sell, you can check the **Availability tab** for each product on its page *(browser only)*. This tab will show you where the product is available for fulfillment based on its size and color. When choosing products fulfilled locally, you can avoid potential customs duties) 💡"

Etsy + Printful: how to set up shipping from the closest location?,1,1gl3515,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1gl3515/etsy_printful_how_to_set_up_shipping_from_the/,3,2024-11-06 23:56:33,"I'm trying to start selling posters on Etsy that are fulfilled by Printful. I find that the shipping story is confusing as hell.

Given that I have a product on Printful with ""free shipping"" on and it's published to Etsy, I expect that:

1. When someone visits my Etsy listing from within Europe, they see that the product ships from a European location (such as Latvia) and the total price includes the price of shipping from Europe to Europe.

2. When someone visits my Etsy listing from the US, they see that the product ships from a US location and the total price includes the price of shipping from the US to the US.

What happens instead is when I visit the listing from Europe, Etsy says it's shipping from the US, which means the total price includes shipping from the US to Europe, which is going to be unnecessarily high, instead of shipping from Europe to Europe.

When I tried to choose a PoD vendor, Printful's promise was that it would fulfill every order closest to the customer's location, but this is apparently not the case.

After searching this subreddit for similar issues, I saw a few commenters suggesting to check if the product chosen on Printful can actually be fulfilled in different countries. However, I looked multiple times at my product description, and I can't see any mentions of where this product can be fulfilled.

What am I doing wrong? How do I achieve the expected shipping experience? Do I need to create two products on Printful, one for the US and one for Europe, and make them only available in the respective regions on Etsy?

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you"

Etsy Taxes using Printful,1,1gkliqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1gkliqp/etsy_taxes_using_printful/,1,2024-11-06 07:12:07,"I am based in Ireland. I have an ETSY store and I want to sell Printful products in both the USA and Europe. 

For a product listing in Etsy, I choose US as the origin in the shipping profile:

1. For US purchase: No additional tax and origin is local (US). All good.
2. For EU purchase: Etsy adds a customs Tax and origin is shown as US.

My question(s):

* If Printful have fulfillment centers in 7 countries (including US and EU) then shouldn't the tax that Etsy are adding be avoidable in the EU?
* Also wouldn't it be more attractive to EU customers if the origin on Etsy could show their nearest Printful fulfillment center (EU)?
* As I type this it seems like more of an Etsy problem than a Printful problem.... surely the whole point of have multiple fulfillment centers is to keep shipping fees and taxes down and be closer to the customer etc?
* Does Printful work like this on other eCommerce platforms?



P.S. I know I could just create 2 listings each time with 2 separate shipping profiles but I'm hoping there is a more efficient way...

Warning - using Printful for Amazon sales is an unwise decision,13,1gebbe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1gebbe1/warning_using_printful_for_amazon_sales_is_an/,7,2024-10-29 02:48:22,"I have stores on Etsy, Ebay, and Amazon. Few hundred products in each store. And I use both Printful and Printify for different products. 

  
My Amazon store, with few hundred products from Printify and few dozen from Printful, just got a notice of risk of deactivation. Reason - most products that go from Printful are either shipped late, past the 5 days handling time, or returned for poor printing quality. Products from Printify have printing issues and returns too from time to time, but it is a rare occasion.

  
Printful, however, - I got a return for poor quality and 2 late shipments in just the last few days. So, I got a notice from Amazon that another late shipment, return, or a feedback less than 3 stars will result in deactivation of my store.

  
I spent 2 days and many hours talking to Printful support. The result is as expected - it is not their fault, they can't do anything about it. They will send me an email later.

  
Ebay and Etsy are much more relaxed about shipping times and returns, I can work with customers there. But Amazon is a whole different game. **Late shipment is an automatic cancellation by Amazon. But at the same time Printful will not cancel an order once it is sent to fulfillment. Even if it has been sitting in that fulfillment for over a week and has been cancelled by Amazon days ago, Printful refuses to cancel it. They send it to the customer anyway.** Once they sent it 3 weeks later, to a customer that cancelled and was refunded.

  
We are not in the holiday rush yet. Imagine what it will be in a few weeks! 

  
BTW, do not believe when they tell you that they print everything on site. They do not. From my countless hours of talking to their customer support I found that they use ""printing partners"" just like Printify. They just do not disclose who those partners are. It is all a smoke show, they don't have their own printing shops. At least Printify is transparent about their providers.

  
I am at a loss here, trying to think what is my next move. The best would be, probably, to remove all Printful products from Amazon and leave only Printify products there.

  
This is not an advertisement for Printify, this is just a rant and warning about my experience. I hope it helps someone to make the right decision."

Trying to limit my delivery to US and Canada, or just the US as I dont want to deal with any returns from the EU.

  
I stumble upon 2 issues:

  
\- if I have free delivery that Etsy now pushes on everyone, adding it to the price only adds the US values. So basically if it costs me 6 dollars to ship to the US or 120 dollars to ship to some third world country, it will still only add 6 dollars to the final price. Unsure how to divide this up by country.

\- so naturally I am just trying to limit where the products can be shipped. But after removing countries, a day passes and printful automatically updates the profiles with the countries again. What Etsy seems to have done is they no longer offer ""Other"" as delivery service. And printful tells us to set ""other"" as their delivery service option. So because of this a) it does not allow you to duplicate a profile made by printful, tweak it and save it (it just doesn't save). b) creating a manual profile has no option for ""Other"" delivery service. 

Can anyone help me figure this out? I am very close to dumping Printful as it seems it's useless for Etsy. And Amazon does their own fulfillments, which does not require Printful. But since I spent so much time on it already I want to see if there's a way to figure it out. They would solve everything by just adding an option to select countries they push the delivery info for...

Issue with Enabling Fulfillment in Shopify for Bulk Products Synced via Printful API,2,1g6vgsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1g6vgsn/issue_with_enabling_fulfillment_in_shopify_for/,0,2024-10-19 06:16:54,"Hi all,

I'm having an issue with enabling fulfillment in Printful for products I sync in bulk through the API. Previously, after syncing products using the **Ecommerce Platform Sync PUT Printful Endpoint**, fulfillment would be automatically enabled, with each variant's stock count set to 9999. However, in the past few weeks, this behavior has changed. Now, synced products are showing up with **Fulfillment disabled** in both Printful and the Printful app within Shopify, and their stock count is set to zero.

Here’s the workflow I’ve been following:

1. I create blank products in Shopify using their API.
2. I sync these products using the Ecommerce Platform Sync PUT Printful Endpoint
3. Normally, the products would then be orderable in Shopify, with the correct stock count.

However, since the change, I’ve had to manually click **Enable Fulfillment** for each product in either Printful or the Printful app in Shopify to fix the issue. This is not scalable for me, as I’m working with hundreds of products at a time. Additionally, attempting to enable fulfillment for many products at once results in errors in the Printful app.

I've reached out to support, but so far, no solution has been found, and they've told me it looks good on their end. Is there a way to either:

1. Change something to go back to the previous behavior where fulfillment was automatically enabled upon syncing?
2. Enable fulfillment programmatically or in bulk through the API (as I haven’t found an endpoint that allows this)?

Any advice or workarounds would be greatly appreciated!"

In the NBA folder there were a few random designs not at all related to the NBA, red flag number one. As I looked through the folders I expected to find a copy of the ""commerical-use license"", none found. I had contacted Printful last week to inquire and they indicated that I would need to submit the commercial-use license before I could print anything. Anyways, I contacted their support team and sure enough, they admitted that there is no commercial license for the ""sports stuff"" although if you look at the NBA, MLB, NHL, packages it all states they do include a commercial license (at the time of this writing anyways). I requested a full refund and will report them to the BBB, FTC and may also let the various sports orgs know as well. I'm bummed, but I had a feeling this was too good to be true!

€47.49 (better be some nice wool at this starting price and not a plastic blend as is the case now), 
€10.19 postage 💀

So 58€ before any marketplace fees and your own cut? So how is one supposed to price these?

My calculations show I'd have to charge $85 on Etsy for these too make just 20% of that in profit with EU taxes. Anything less than 20% is just not reasonable, and even 20 is very iffy.

So... Shopify only? And only to areas with smaller sales tax / VAT?

Or are people really gonna pay $85+ for a thin plastic sweater?

17-30 days delivery is also brutal... good luck with Christmas sweaters and all the chargebacks around them.

- have read customer service is poor with printify

I've chatted with tech support who fed me a bunch of nonsense about my items not being synched. It doesn't make any sense. Other than that they basically said I must be doing something else wrong on my end. Useless.

And you can only change pricing in bulk... not the price of an individual size. To that they told me I could create a template from the product and then edit those elements. That's all well and good except for the fact that templates do not retain your title, text, tags mockups or pricing... the most time consuming part creating products. This is getting exhausting. And yet, I know I can edit all of these elements (with the exception of product, colors and design) in Etsy but that's neither here nor there.

First off the customer services for just basic quality control concerns is nonexistent, so good luck getting anything quality-related resolved. They will just give you the run around through email (no phone service) and promise you that they are taking it up with the “fulfillment team”, in hopes you will eventually give up. I contacted them after spending nearly $400 on samples and receiving ALL of my t-shirt prints scaled down in size from what I uploaded using their template! It’s been weeks and still no resolution. As far as the white label features, they offer custom printing of the inside label, but you are forced to keep their template and can only add your customization logo or whatever to a small portion. The part they force you to keep the is not appealing whatsoever and worst of all it says “Made in Nicaragua” and there is no way to remove it. You can imagine how that looks if you say your brand is Made in the USA but the label says otherwise. Completely defies the entire purpose of a custom label. Additionally, their custom “packing insert” option and “custom packaging” is a joke. They charge you an arm and a leg just to store a tiny box of stickers and poly mailers. I thought is was only $25 a month but they add bogus fees, and if you want everything returned to you because you changed your mind they rob you and say it will cost hundreds to be returned. My overall experience with Printful was definitely a learning experience and unfortunately will no longer be using their services. Beware they may deceive you into thinking it’s great for “brands” but that couldn’t be farther from the truth. They are all about doing cooker-cutter, choppy, and cheap. They don’t care about your brand at all. "

My other (more expensive) option is the Comfort Colors 1717, as this appears to be a heavier weight at 6oz. Love to hear from anyone who has embroidered this shirt too about general quality.

Hi there folks, we just had our first integrated Printful/TikTok shop sale. I waited for the hold period to end in TikTok, then an hour after that I still don't see the order in the Printful dashboard. How long does it usually take in your experience from the customer order to appear on the Printful dashboard?

I double/triple checked everything with the integration and swear I had all the sync/shipping/warehouse info correct. Is this a normal wait period?

I have currently in the process of about a $3,500 shirt order. This order consists of multiple designs and sizes. I would say in all there about 30 different designs, all within the Small and 2x range.

  
My main complaint with printful is that it does its ""Draft auto save"" after every time I make a few minor changes. This is fine, I'm glad it's saving what I have. But as my order gets longer and longer, it begins to take around 30-45 seconds to save this draft. This means, after EVERY single change I make, I have to wait 30-45 seconds for the page to save as a draft.

  
If I want to go in and change a size on something? 30 second wait. Update a quantity? 30 second wait.

Is there a more streamlined process than this? Am I missing something here? There's no way an order like this should take 2 hours.

I'm fine with it saving as a draft, but it should let me choose when I want to save, and not force the save like this."

Guess what? They do not cancel orders that are marked in their system as sent to fulfillment. It will be sent to the customer no matter what, and when? Maybe in a few days, or in a few weeks - they don't know.

At that time I pretty much said good bye to the $40 cost of the item. But then they offered to change the shipping address to my home address. Oh well, now I will have a nice thing that I designed. Not bad outcome after all.

I only ask because on the AOP jackets,  they dont print on facings. they just reverse the print so the facings look bad if there is any thing besides a pattern on the jacket, so it will get part of a logo or what have you on the front of the piece which makes it look messy and unprofessional.

Literally had to take a 20 minute taxi ride to get there. I didn't pay $28.99 for this.

I had a great experience from Gelato regarding the delivery. The delivery was very short, it was cheaper and they actually delivered the goods to my doorstep. The only reason I switched to printful was due to it's huge selection of products which had great embroidery.

I had reached out to printful regarding this issue and they told me to reach out to the Postal office. Why would anyone give the delivery responsibility to a local postal office. In my country and many others, nobody uses it and plus its incredibly slow.

I thought printful would handle everything from production to delivery.

Can I design multiple wall art products at once?

It feels like I have been creating the products forever and yet I've only gotten all of my designs on a couple of products.

I want each design to be available as every wall art product and bunch of apparel. But going through the full design process for each product is taking forever, compared to something like RedBubble.

I don't understand the purpose of the product templates at all. I just tried taking my product template for a ""Framed Enhanced Matte Paper Poster"" and switching the product to ""Framed Glossy Premium Photo Paper"" thinking that everything would stay the same. But as soon as I changed the product, everything reset. All of the sizes were selected, and for some reason my design was tiled across the poster and completely off-center.

So what is the point of the templates if they just reset every time you change them in any way? A 'template' should let you insert a new design or switch to a similar product. Why not just go to make a new product every time?

Plus, my understanding is that the only way to get more than one mockup on your product page is to download the images and then upload them on your site.

Other POD sites I've used you can take a design and apply it to a bunch of different products at once, have the same descriptions for each design, etc.

Is there a particular browser that Printful works better with? I'm using Chrome and I'm losing my mind.

TL;DR: Is there a way to streamline the product creation process by doing multiple at one time? The same goes for mockups? Any instructional videos on how to do it?

Thank you."

There are two layers. One is ""Guide (TURN OFF)"". The other is ""Place Graphic Here"". The ""Guide"" layer has a lot going on: the Printful logo, dimensions, a picture of a shirt with a red-dotted-line box inside of it, some notes at the bottom telling me to turn off the ""Guide"" layer. The thing is, am I supposed to design INSIDE the red-dotted-line box, or am I supposed to turn off the guide right away and use that whole space to design?

The file size doesn't even match the suggested print size: The file's size is 1725 x 2295 pixels, but the maximum print area is 11.5"" x 15.3"", which is 1104 x 1468.8 pixels. If I crappily crop the file down to the red-dotted-line box, the file size is about 551 x 713.

However, When you create a shipping profile manually the ""Other"" selection is missing.

Secondly, If you try and duplicate the printful profile, it just won't work. Instead a red banner at the top of the screen that reads ""We could not update your profile."" 

Lastly, In my situation I needed to edit the Printful shipping profile so I can have free shipping in the US, and leave international prices set as Printful has them. However the next day Printful reverts my edit and the free shipping is removed.

So at this point ---->  It's frankly not possible todo Free Shipping in US only and have International Rates applied with a Printful shipping profile.  You have to manually create your own and once you do selecting ""Other"" as the shipping service, which printful recommends is missing. I have no clue what service to choose that matches the costs of printful.

When creating an order a (suggested?) ""retail price"" is listed next to the item. This can be edited. I was wondering if the sales tax that Printful collects is based on this price, or based on Printful's costs+profit, or on some other metric. 

I intend to place an order for a bunch of tees, and to have them available as a fundraising item for a local political group. My cost is based on the Printful invoice including tax, plus a $5 markup per tee and the group can sell them for whatever they want above my cost+markup. 

My question concerns how to obtain an accurate Printful total during the process of creating the order based on my intended use/sales of the tees. If I change the item ""retail price"" does that change the sales tax figure, hence the Printful invoice, and hence my costs? I don't consider this as a retail item, and I don't have any problem with paying a sales tax, I just don't want to unintentionally over-pay the tax! I was thinking of attempting to closely estimate my costs(incl. tax)+ markup *before* placing the order. Any suggestions/links would be appreciated!

Pint glasses - is this a problem?,3,1esdeyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1esdeyg/pint_glasses_is_this_a_problem/,3,2024-08-15 04:33:57,"I recently sent out  several rounds of pint glasses (all the same art). Many of the orders came in back to back so they were likely batched together. 

In the first round, customers are reporting to me that there is a sticky residue on the design. I know UV printing is used for these glasses. Was the design not properly cured or is this normal and the residue will wear away? 

I’m inclined to believe this is a manufacturing mistake but was hoping for feedback before I start re-processing a bunch of orders. I had a design go viral over the weekend and now I’m terrified a bunch of bad product is going out. 😬

I need someone with some experience selling on Amazon through the Printful integration.  
How you configure your shipping prices?  
The Printful tutorial says that is best to leave it by default, so the Amazon shipping template shows mostly free shipping, that's why I charge Printful shipping cost in the final price. But I'm thinking that if the person wants to buy more than one item it has to pay a lot more in the end, so it may lead to abandoned cart.

# Background

I run a WordPress WooCommerce store with the Printful plugin. My store has been active for \~6 months with everything working fine. I'm experienced with WordPress, not as much with WooCommerce.

When I push new products to my store, I choose the simplest mockup/ product images to make the push easier. I then create my own product images and upload them to WordPress, replacing the ones from the Printful push.

# The Issue

When I add my own product photos, it breaks the link between the photos and the color dropdown menu. Meaning when I change the selected color, the corresponding product photo is not automatically shown.

I did a test and pushed a random product to my store, *leaving the product photos from Printful.* When I did this,  selecting a color automatically switched to the corresponding product photo.

# How do I 'link' my new product photos to the color dropdown?

Any guidance appreciated. Thanks.

I see here Fulfillment fees ? So if we add say a tshirt and 50 people buy it and Printful profit is $10 per shirt we need pay $500 before they mail to customer ? I thought the whole point of POD was not paying out of your own pocket . Is this the same rule if we sell from Printful to Etsy or Shopify . I am just starting out so I can’t pay $10 per item sold or whatever the cost  per unit is upfront . Kinda bummed if this is the case cuz I have what I believe can be a viral shirt design

"Custom API integration question - adding a ""service fee"" to the order creation request.",3,1e5amqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1e5amqw/custom_api_integration_question_adding_a_service/,2,2024-07-17 12:48:49,"Hi! Over the past few weeks I created my own store website front-end and back-end from scratch and integrated it with Printful, making the entire process from designing products to shipping completely automated.

I am, however, facing an issue.

I am adding a ""service fee"" as another order item on my side. This is something else than the markup. My markup is added to each order item already in the request to Printful, so that works fine. The service fee is more or less calculated from all of the products at once and is a lump sum that should work like another, singular item added to the order.

What doesn't work is telling printful to account for that ""service fee"" in the final breakdown for the customer.

I simply don't know where to put it in the API request. I tried sending it together with all the other printful items added to the order but Pintful, expectedly, is ignoring that item.

I also can't really spread the service fee across all items because then the final breakdown might be off due to rounding errors.

Do you guys know a solution for this?"
Using printful without integration,1,1e4xsnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1e4xsnn/using_printful_without_integration/,1,2024-07-17 02:40:40,"Hi there! Basically I already have an Etsy and my own website and have been trading for four years pretty successfully. I'd like to add a few personalised print on demand bits but I was wondering whether I could do this without integrating Printful with Shopify and Etsy? 

I don't expect to have many sales via this channel and obviously everything needs uploading before placing the order on Printful because they're personalised anyway. I was wondering whether I'd run into any issues doing it this way, aside from it taking time to input shipping details etc? 

Also thinking long term, if I'd already started without integrating would I then be unable to integrate in the future if I suddenly saw a jump in sales and needed things automating, or if I started selling non-personalised things? 

Essentially I'm super set in my ways and how I like my listings to look and how I like my shipping profiles etc and when I uploaded an item from my Printful templates I was just really unhappy with how it looked

I have printed with them for years, and its been a couple years since any issues, but of course when I do a large order that's when the issues arise.  I have used the same gradient for 3 years for a lot of different merch and this time the colors are so far off the client wants a reprint or a refund.   Of course, they said that it falls within an acceptable range of sublimation variation or whatever, so I am stuck with the bill on this one.  Printful also said I could resubmit and it may have the same result.  This order also included tumblers, as well as jerseys and hoodies.  The tumblers look great - hoodies and jerseys completely different.  I also got polos done with same files and they look great (yoycol) I stopped using printful for DTG because the quality suffered and I got left with an unhappy client and lost 3k replacing the last print issues.  Anyone else having issues the last month?  Looks like I am out another $500 regardless.   Is there a chance bigger orders go somewhere else?  90% of our orders are one or two products at a time.

I've selected to ship to all English speaking countries on Printful that also showed Australia and New Zealand. I've also added a printing partner in Charlotte US (based on a YouTube tutorial). 

Now, I've created my first listing, and as I'm in the UK, it shows the price in GBP plus Delivery fees + custom duty taxes. 

My question is, how can I ensure and select that people who order from US receive the shipment from US and people who order from UK receive it from UK? It would be great if you could provide the steps in either Printful or Etsy.

Hi, 

I decided to start a Shopify store a few days ago. My question is, once I sync my store to Printful, do all of the shipping and fulfillment processes happen automatically? For example, if a consumer purchases a T-shirt from my Shopify site, the order will be automatically updated in Printful's system and transferred to one of the fulfillment centers (do I need to sign up for these centers or is it just default?). From there, they will help me deliver to the customer's address. Is this correct? 

Also, what should I put in the shipping origin box? Printfull (App) is in there, so does that conclude what I meant above is true? 

Thanks "
Query on VAT for UK based seller - new seller non-VAT registered,0,1dvhav5,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1dvhav5/query_on_vat_for_uk_based_seller_new_seller/,1,2024-07-05 04:04:12,"I am a UK-based seller looking only to serve UK customers. I am new to POD and dropshipping so I want to keep things simple until I gain more experience and stick to domestic customers only for now.

As this is a side hustle and I am new to this I am not VAT registered in the UK or anywhere else for that matter.

I am trying to understand a specific example to help me understand VAT, pricing, etc. but have found it difficult to find a clear example or confirmation.

Let's say I am trying to sell a laptop sleeve.

my fulfilment costs are:  
Printful price: £15.95  
Printful shipping: £4.99  
Subtotal: £20.94  
VAT 20%: £4.19  
**Printful fulfilment total: £25.13**

ok great, so I set my retail price to say printful price +20% so £30.15, seems reasonable to make a few quid on a laptop sleeve. Any more and I think it's getting a bit too pricey for a simple laptop sleeve. It's already quite expensive IMO.

End customer price  
Retail price: £30.15  
Customer shipping cost: £4.99  
**Total customer price: £35.14**

Transaction Fees and tax (VAT) (currently only using Paypal as my payment gateway)  
VAT @ 20%: £5.86  
Paypal variable fee 2.9%: £1.02  
Paypay fixed transaction fee: £0.30  
Total Paypal Fees: £1.32  
**Total deductions (Printful price + fees + VAT): £32.30**

Do I need to deduct the VAT? I am not VAT registered and my current turnover is well below the VAT threshold

Does PayPal withhold this VAT amount even if I am not tax-registered?

My profit  
Profit:  £2.84  
Margin: 8.07%

Seems a bit thin, if I need to subtract the VAT

Just looking for some clarity for a UK-based, UK-serving seller."

It's a rally vintage inspired design, so it does have a picture of the car and the sponsor logos. (camel cigarettes being one of them). Because the printable area on the default shirts wasn't big enough for my liking, so I chose an All-Over print.

however using the white AOP, I had to cover the rest of the shirt with the base colour (yellow) I wanted. 

See pic for reference, only showing the front, the back is a big print, hence the AOP as explained.

  
My questions are two: will the print work? I assume the inside of the shirt will be white? And will they not print it since it has company logos on the design? Again here only for personal use but printful obvs don't know that. Will they refund me if they can't print it because of copyright infringement?

  
Thanks

I would like to sell some t-shirts as merchandising for my instagram followers.

As I said, I connected Printful and created my products, now the third step the website is telling me to complete is ""Set up billing"". Just to be sure I understood the right thing: I should add a payment method (like PayPal if I can) so that, every time someone orders something from my store, Printful can take my money to produce a t-shirt. But at the same time I would receive the payment of the t-shirt on my Shopify balance, right? Example: I want to sell the t- shirt for 25$, I receive the 25$ on Shopify but at the same time Printful takes about 10$ from my PayPal that I added (step 3 I mentioned). For this reason it cannot happen that I go to a loss.

Also, is it possible to transfer all of my Shopify balance on the same PayPal I set up as the Printful payment method automatically every time I receive an order, so that my PayPal account will never be empty?

Thank you so much if you can help me out and I hope everything is clear!"

How to Customize Design Placement for Different AirPod Case Versions on Printful?,0,1dpkhic,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1dpkhic/how_to_customize_design_placement_for_different/,2,2024-06-27 13:21:29,"Hi everyone,

I'm using Printful to design AirPod cases, and I'm running into an issue. The cases come in different versions (AirPods 1/2, Pro, etc.), and each version has a different shape. When I change the position of my image for one version, it automatically changes the position for all versions, which doesn't work since the shapes are different.

Is there a way to customize the design placement for each AirPod case version individually, so one position doesn't apply to all variants? Any tips or steps on how to do this would be greatly appreciated!

I've noticed that when someone orders from outside of the UK, I make a good profit (US customers make me around £2, EU customers make me around £0.80), but when someone orders from the UK the most I've made is £0.01, and on my most recent order from the UK I even made -£0.56, so I lost 56p.

Can someone explain what is actually going on and how I can resolve it? I've been trying to understand what it is and I just can't quite get it. You can stop reading here if that's all the information you need, but I'm also going to give you the most recent orders' pricing breakdown in case it helps:

Subtotal = £8.50

Shipping (Flat Rate) = £4.29

VAT = £2.56

Total = £15.35

Customer Paid = £14.79 (thus, I lost 56p...)

Cheers,

A struggling Etsy seller :)

I've now just read that even if I register as a VAT Taxpayer and get a UK VAT ID I still get charged 20% for orders fulfilled and delivered domestically within the UK, so is there even anything I can do apart from increasing costs? If so, this is incredibly disappointing...

Seeking Advice: What Should I Know Before Going Live with My Printful Print-on-Demand Store?,0,1djpf11,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1djpf11/seeking_advice_what_should_i_know_before_going/,6,2024-06-20 00:52:29,"

Hi Printful Community,

I'm in the final stages of setting up my print-on-demand store using Printful, and I could really use some advice from those of you who have already gone through this process. What are the key things I should know or do before launching?

Here are some specific questions I have:

1. Shipping: 
How does the shipping process work with Printful? Are there any common issues I should be aware of, and how can I best communicate shipping times to my customers?

2. Policies:
What policies should I have in place (returns, exchanges, etc.)? Are there any templates or examples you recommend?

3. Marketing:
What marketing strategies have been most effective for you? Any tips on leveraging social media, email marketing, or paid ads to drive traffic and sales?

4. Pre-launch Must-Dos:
What are the absolute must-dos before going live? Are there any particular settings, integrations, or checks that are crucial to avoid problems down the line?

5. Lessons Learned: 
What do you wish you knew before launching your store? Any mistakes to avoid or lessons learned that could save me time and headaches?

I'm excited to get started but want to ensure I'm as prepared as possible. Any insights, tips, or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance for your help!

Looks like DTF is available for very few products which is a bit of a bummer but my main concern is that the estimated delivery times are wild; 5-17 days and 10-30 (?!?) days for the two shirts I would consider using (USA). Delivery times are quite long with wide ranges for other products too. Is this a recent Printful issue that’s expected to improve or do I need to find another print company to work with?

Also the new cloth for sweatshirts seems thinner and as I use sweatshirts as a warm layer in winter I am less enthusiastic about it

On another note your create a garment process is pretty good - would like the 3D panel on more products.  I do get confused though about print quality.  most of my photos come from a pretty good camera and are   around 5000X3000  and sometimes your system enhances them (which is fine by me) sometimes not.  ( is there a way to trigger that?) For tee shirts etc it works better if image is portrait so 3000 by 5000 but often the better shot is landscape and I want a slice of it....and these often give a larger image would be better warning....

or I suppose I have somewhere the facility to enlarge pixels before sending them could you let me know what pixel count works best in things like sweat shirts, tee shirts etc...

How to double your revenue from email campaigns ,2,1dbm9sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1dbm9sq/how_to_double_your_revenue_from_email_campaigns/,0,2024-06-09 12:25:01,"This post is all about deliverability. The basic math equation is simple. More people will buy from your emails if more people see your emails. So if your open rates are below 20%, you can probably double them by just following the basic tips I give you below.

With that being said, let's get started.

Here are 10 things you should avoid doing regularly if you want to have good deliverability:

1. Don’t keep unengaged members on your email list. If your business isn't seasonal and someone hasn't opened your emails in over 6 months you should consider either reducing the volume of emails that are sent to them or completely removing them from your email list. They will bring your open rates down and this will increase your chances of being marketed as spam.

1. Break your list down. Segmentation does not matter if you have less than 2k emails. But once you get to 10k+ emails You’ll need these 4 basic segments: Buyers, Non-buyer, Engaged customers, and Non-engaged customers. You can personalize emails based on what they have bought/viewed. This alone will significantly boost your open rates. Think of it like this, what’s more likely to be opened? FREE SHIPPING on everything Today Only OR You’re in luck🎲 – Free Shipping for the next 6 hours in {{Users\_city}} (while recommending items that they have viewed recently in the email)

1. Beware of spam filters - Did you know that you could get blacklisted? If your domain is unhealthy your emails will almost always go directly to spam. It's almost impossible to revive a domain so be careful how you go about sending from your main domain. Also if you burnt a domain in the past from 1 IP address it's likely that if you create a new domain using that same IP address your 2nd domain also will be negatively affected. If you use a shifty email sending provider you will also run into spam filter problems.

1. Write a good subject line. The subject line is the single most important aspect of email copywriting. There are typically only 2 types of good subject lines. Subject lines to make people curious and subject lines that are direct (Typically with a good offer). That’s literally all there is to it. Also, don't lead with a misleading subject line. Pissing people off is the easiest way to get spam complaints instead of normal unsubscribes. (Spam complaints are way worse for deliverability)

1. Don't be inconsistent. Algorithms love consistency. This is why the number 1 way to boost engagement on almost any social platform ever created is to post consistently and follow some sort of routine. Emails aren't different at all. Try to email your most engaged segment every week. This will give you a good average open rate and also it will show the email service provider that people interact with your content regularly.

1. Don't try to hide the unsubscribe button. Not having an unsubscribe button is illegal but some people just try to use cheat codes like making the unsubscribe text white on a white background. This is the easiest way to increase spam complaints greatly. Customers should never feel like you're forcing them to do anything.

1. Don't send emails from shady domains. You should have a clear professional-looking sender address. Use a business domain, not a regular email account. Avoid using any random characters anywhere in the domain and do everything you can to make it very clear where the email is coming from.

1. Make sure your grammar is on point. Typos of any kind can be a red flag for spam filters. It's impossible to be perfect all the time but at least try to make sure your emails have less typos than this Reddit post.

1. Never buy email lists and use them for B2C marketing. Sending to people without their consent is the worst thing that you could possibly do if you're trying to avoid the spam filter. Make sure every single email address that is receiving your emails has opted in.

1. Don't use spammy copywriting. Most people have literally no idea what this means so I put together a list of things that are generally bad. Here is the list of things to avoid: Using all caps for subject lines, capitalizing every word in your subject lines all the time, using large fonts, using fonts smaller than size 8 font in main bodies of sales copy, overusing words like FREE or SALE in your subject lines and over using emojis.

I want to end this with a reminder that no one is above spam filters. If you go to your spam folder right now you'll probably see at least one 8 figure company stuck in there multiple times. These people hire ""experts"" and pay them thousands every month and still can't figure it out. So just because your emails are doing okay now, just know that can change fast if you are not careful."

2.5 million in sales while paid ads are turned off,21,1d0uuat,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1d0uuat/25_million_in_sales_while_paid_ads_are_turned_off/,4,2024-05-26 12:57:48,"Before I get into the good parts of this post here's a quick disclaimer:  
- This brand did 1.8 million the year before  
- I do not own this brand, I was hired to build a cult-following  
- paid ads were being ran for the first quarter of the year but not converting well

That's relevant information because not every brand can see massive success without paid ads. Most of the things I talk about in this post are pretty much useless if you do under 15k/month. Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about what I did to nearly double this brand's revenue without dumping more money into ads.

**For those who don't like reading, I'll summarize what I did right here: I built a community around the brand.**

So I'll break down what I did into 5 steps:

1. Obtained a shit load of user-generated content

I was able to get 300 videos of people using the brand's products in under 60 days.  
This is easier than it seems. People pay influencers thousands to pose with their products. For a brand with a bit of traction, the value in user-generated content is to get products in front of a larger audience; Not necessarily for social proof (like it is for smaller brands). So with that being said, don't spend a lot of money on UGC content unless it's for a promotional post on a page with a large following.

Don't fixate on having the prettiest videos. Give a wide variety of people the opportunity to submit content.

3 ways you can get user-generated content for free/cheap are:

- Use your social media channels to offer a free product in exchange for a video review  
- Setup a review email flow, offer existing customers a chance at a full refund for a video testimonial that meets certain criteria  
- Directly contact influencers and negotiate/hire someone with a network of influencers to do the negotiation process for you

2. Created a blog

I designed a blog page on the website and posted on it 1-2 times per week. I used Ai to generate in-season ideas for blog posts, then got my copywriter to do some research and come up with short blog posts that were informative and read well. P.S Just using chatgpt to pump out blog content can work but the content will never be as engaging as content written by a real person that understands the marketing angle. We also tried to add user-generated content on the blog pages as much as we could.

This is by far the easiest way to get people back onto your site without them feeling like you're trying to sell them more products. This is the base of the next 3 steps. Good blog content makes people in your niche excited to hear from you. This will boost your email open rates, allow you to post in groups that are heavily moderated against promotions, and give you a lot of niche-specific copywriting to work with.

3. Created a subreddit (or any type of group)

I created a subreddit for this brand, then I spent hours finding niche-relevant content. Then, I queued a whole bunch of posts. I did a mix of reposting content from tiktok, instagram, youtube, etc, and posting the site's blog posts and UGC content. Growing the community was tricky but once I got some momentum going it was almost growing itself.

There's major upside to owning a community inside of your niche. You can block your competitors from posting in your sub and post as much promotional content as you want. You can also mix content, so people have no idea if you're promoting a store, sharing a funny photo, or giving a useful recommendation. You'd honestly be shocked by the amount of traffic our weekly pinned post brought to the site.

4. Discord community

I used social media, Reddit, and emails to grow the community to 11 thousand members in under a year. Customers were giving design ideas, connecting with store employees, and volunteering to send content with products for FREE.

This is like a reddit community but more personal. The main difference between the discord and the reddit is that the discord is branded and the Reddit is just niche specific. This is a good place to run competitions and polls, and also just interact with customers on a personal level. You can get a tone of UGC from a discord community if you use it right.

5. Email and SMS marketing

I saved the best for last. Normally my posts are mainly focused on emails but I thought I'd switch it up today to truly convey what goes on behind the scenes of well-coordinated email/sms marketing.  
Think of emails as an ongoing conversation between you and your customer. You play the role of a friend recommending things to a peer. You already know things about them, like their interests, location, and buying habits. Now use segmentation and predictive analytics to make sure relevant content gets sent to interested people. I'll leave it at that.

But before I leave I'll share some more info about this brand that may be relevant. It's a breed-specific animal brand, this brand has been around for about 4 years and has consistently grown 30-40% each year with last year being an outlier (almost doubled sales), the people in this niche are extremely passionate about their pets so this may have made it easier for me to grow a community this quickly, and the 2.5 million that I am attributing to my systems are just the sales that came from EMAIL and SMS marketing.  
Thanks so much for taking the time to read my post, Id be happy to provide more clarity on any of the subjects that I mentioned in this post."
Dealing with transparency/gaps in DTG - would this work?,1,1d19mtx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1d19mtx,8,2024-05-27 02:54:28,"Never worked with DTG before and in my art I tend to use a lot of brushes that leave strokes and stipples and etc which I understand won’t print well (example image 1 with added garish pink background to help highlight transparency of colours).

My idea for a solution: if I just use a solid fill as a kind of “backing” behind the art using a light beige or dark grey, depending on the image, would this solve the issue of disconnected and “transparent” elements? (Image 2, beige added in solid behind any area with any stippling)

I realize it will impact the overall image and colours etc but if I can make that work, will it print essentially as I see it? 

And if this will theoretically work, do I need to fill the whole image (Image 3 with whole outline filled) or just the space behind/around where the artwork is more transparent?

Thanks for helping a newbie out!

I've tried downloading it by PNG and JPEG, made sure that all the dimensions are correct, and made sure that I removed the background on the design before downloading it on my files. And to no avail, the background still shows up on the shirt no matter what color the shirt is. I'm worried that this will do the same with the actual product. Has anybody came across with this problem before with Kittl and Printful and if so, what have you done to fix it? "

Processing and shipping times keep getting overwritten in Etsy,1,1cxlfyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1cxlfyk/processing_and_shipping_times_keep_getting/,2,2024-05-22 06:00:25,"Hello! I think this has been asked before and I've read some posts but I'm still confused.

My orders have averaged about 7-10 days from order placed to delivered within the US. 

I want that to reflect in my shipping on Etsy (with maybe a day or 2 buffer just in case).

But looks like Printful keeps overwriting the times to be something crazy like 3-9 days processing with 3-18 days shipping. Or something crazy like that. 

I'm afraid this could potentially scare away customers who might see a 6-27 day shipping window...

Should I set up a custom shipping profile in Etsy for those items that are averaging 7-10 days? Will there be any drawbacks to doing that? 

TIA!"
Advice needed any help appreciated ,1,1cxeh38,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1cxeh38/advice_needed_any_help_appreciated/,10,2024-05-22 01:09:07,"Hi Reddit community,

I’m planning to create a series of custom shirts featuring some iconic sayings. I’ll be using Printful for this project and I want to make sure I’m doing everything correctly to achieve the best results.

Here’s a bit about what I’m aiming to do:
- I have a list of 60 iconic sayings along with the date and location where they were said.
- I want to design these sayings to be printed on shirts and possibly other items like hoodies, mugs, etc.

I have a few questions and would love your advice:

1. **Design Tips**: What are some best practices for designing text-based graphics for shirts? Are there any specific fonts or design elements that work best for this type of content?
   
2. **Printful Setup**: What’s the best way to set up my designs in Printful? Should I use their built-in design tool, or is it better to create the designs in a separate program like Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop and then upload them?
   
3. **File Formats**: What file formats and sizes should I use to ensure high-quality prints?
   
4. **Mockups**: How can I create realistic mockups to see how the shirts will look before placing an order? Any tips on using Printful’s mockup generator effectively?
   
5. **Marketing and Sales**: Any advice on marketing and selling these shirts once they’re ready? Are there particular platforms or strategies that work well for custom apparel?

Thank you in advance for your help! I’m really excited about this project and appreciate any tips or insights you can provide.

I hope you’re all doing well! I’m reaching out to the Printful community today to rally support for an awesome streetwear shirt that I think a lot of us would love to have available in the US and UK – the United Athle 5508-01.

This shirt is great when it comes to streetwear fit and style. It’s known for its balance  of comfortable and oversized fit, making it perfect for that relaxed, streetwear look we all love. Plus, it comes at a reasonable cost, making it a great addition to our wardrobe without breaking the bank.

The good news is that Printful would consider bringing this shirt to our region, but they need our votes to make it happen! If you'd like this to happen as much as I would, please take a moment to cast your vote and help make this a reality. I didn't create the request but I share its sentiment.

Also, when the order is fulfilled in Spain, it takes forever to get to my country ( I sell in the Netherlands). To me, it seems like it’s getting here by truck and takes at least 3 days to get here, as when from Latvia it’s here in 1 day.

Are these profit margins typical when selling an allover athletic t-shirt from Printful?,4,1cox0yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1cox0yt/are_these_profit_margins_typical_when_selling_an/,6,2024-05-11 01:51:38,"Hi everyone. I'll get the good news out of the way. I made my first sell today after getting the website live only 5 days ago!

However, on selling it for £29.50+shipping (so £32.79), I only made £2.14 in profit, and this is before Stripe took £0.69 in payment fees. So I seem to only be making £1.45 on each sale. Which seems really low since the customer spent £32.79 on the t-shirt, including VAT and shipping fees.

Typically I would have expected at least 5%-20% margins, based on other industries I've worked in. Especially since Printful themselves say to expect 30% to 50% in their article at [https://www.printful.com/uk/blog/how-much-money-can-custom-t-shirts-make](https://www.printful.com/uk/blog/how-much-money-can-custom-t-shirts-make)

I know the most obvious answer is to put the price up, but the quality of the t-shirts do not justify the price being higher, even when the graphics are good (which I pay around £100 each time to be done professionally). The t-shirts are very simply constructed compared to others of a similar price range.

If they had a couple tweaks, like a support fabric on the back of the neck, and maybe a bit better fabric, it would be fine. But it really is a simple construction, even compared to t-shirts of the same and less cost from other small brands. (I'm still figuring that one out). Like how does Ben Parkes (a famous runner) sell running t-shirts cheaper with a better quality, or Happy Stride/Red Bear?

Any advice? Or should I just use Printful as a testing ground for designs and start getting a factory involved to make them in bulk?

Thanks in advance.

2: When applying for brand approval (i think?) do I need to apply for a GTIN exception? I thought if you had a trademarked brand you dont need codes or anything like this and it would just accept?

3: Extending on point 2, do I need to take photos of ALL of the products I want to sell with the packaging? I want to affix my trademarked logo to my clothes. Do I just need to do this once or for all?

Can someone suggest optimal step process here to ensure smooth setup? Ive watched the official printful video but theres these questions that arent answered.

The catch is each user will have a specific design (ie print file) just for them—it’s based on specific data my app will pull in. A user should only be able to view and purchase their own design. The flow I’m imagining is something like: user authorizes our app to pull their data > our app creates design and adds to printful for mock-up purposes > user orders design on product via e-commerce backend.

Is this sort of filtering/flow possible with any of the Printful integrations, or how might I accomplish this? My confusion is how I can sync newly created ad-hoc products in Printful with the storefront but not have them visible to users other than the one they “belong” to. It would be fine if the product was session-scoped and had to be recreated if the user abandoned the flow and came back later on another device, etc (that is, I don’t necessarily need a login with a permissioning model)."

My Shopify store is not collecting taxes because small businesses are not required to do so unless 30k in revenue is generated. Do not have a GST number for this reason but all orders with Printful charge me tax because I don’t have an exemption certificate.

Today I sold 2 items and I’m stuck paying almost $15 in tax out of pocket. I’m sure (?) Printful won’t refund me the taxes I paid them already but is there anything I can do to recoup some of this money? As a last resort can the taxes be deducted when filing income tax?

I don’t expect to make many (any) more sales with this store and currently planning on shutting it down at the end of the month since it was based on an event that has passed.

I’m not sure I’ll break even with my sales after factoring in the costs of the store, domain, a bit of advertising, etc.

I was treating this as a learning opportunity but getting a larger sale with such poor margins is a bit discouraging.  Also, Printful charges a small additional shipping fee for each additional item and I’m stuck paying for that too because the store can only charge for the first time and live shipping is only available with Shopify Advanced. I have already lost money on a few orders with multiple items. "

Square Integration Shipping Issue,4,1bwlnq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1bwlnq1/square_integration_shipping_issue/,4,2024-04-05 22:59:50,"Hello. I've just started using printful and have tried to connect it to my square account so I can sell products on my [website](https://littlestdinosaur.square.site/merch). I've managed to add some products to the site and thought I had everything set up properly, but then I had a customer contact me saying that her address is not supported. I tried other addresses but couldn't even get my own address to work, so now I'm thinking I've done something wrong along the way or skipped a step. Can't find anything on printful or square website to clarify.

It was my assumption that when using printful to publish to square, printful would handle the shipping and that the cost of shipping would be added upon checkout based on the address. Should be automatic. Is this a glitch on square's end, printful's end, or user error (maybe I need to do something to fix it)?

Edit: 

Have managed to fix this issue. It turns out it is not automatically done from Printful, but I needed to add the shipping profiles for each item and location manually! Printful provides the shipping rates on their site but these are not pushed from printful to square when adding the item from printful. I also learned that all of the items from printful were showing up as out of stock, although they are print on demand and therefore have unlimited stock. The solution to this was to go into the item variations and select ""tracking"" and for the reason, select ""received stock."" For the amount of stock received, I simply entered 999999999 so this item should no longer run out of stock.

I still haven't figured out how to lower the shipping rate for additional items. For example, selling a backpack in Canada, the shipping rate is as follows:

|Canada|C$14.55|+C$7.95|
|:-|:-|:-|


I could only figure out how to set one shipping rate. I therefore selected $14.55, but customers should be getting a discounted rate of $7.95 if ordering multiples. If anyone knows how to fix this, I'd be so grateful!"

Now, most videos on YouTube seem to suggest going with Printify, but looking deeper into it, I think Printful is the better choice for me.

Yes, it may work out more expensive at first glance, however, I really want my product to have a high quality.  And not just the physical product itself, but also the overall shopping experience for the customer.

So, although it is more expensive, I think the high quality product and service will bring back repeat customers, and create more word of mouth and positive reviews, leading to more future sales and therefore more profit in the long run.

At least that's my current line of thinking.

But I definitely want to hear what others have to say.

I am thinking of having a printed logo on the back of the shirts (inside or outside, not yet decided).  Or maybe an embroidered logo.  I also want some decent packaging with a friendly note card of some kind, to thank them for the purchase and hopefully it will act as a reminder or just some good will to bring them back to the store again.

Again, this is essentially more expense for me on my end, but I am hoping it leads to a better quality service and therefore more profit in the long run.

Someone also mentioned sending a heartwarming email to any customers thanking them for the purchase too.

Does anyone have any other ideas or recommendations like this?

A two pronged problem, all related to shipping globally.

\#1 I'm doing a little project with my son to give him some work experience in graphic design and ecommerce through setting up POD in an Etsy shop, and maybe he'll make a little bit of pocket money for the summer. We've uploaded some templates into our printful account, but ran into a small snag.   
The first product we tried to create using one of our own uploaded templates stated that the T-shirt design was not available in our sales region (UK) (didn't mention that in the template creation section), but I thought POD was global in delivery and that Printful would use the nearest fulfilment centre to the customer (the Etsy Customer) , so I'm confused why it doesn't allow us to upload the design for sales in regions where it is available.  


2# I read on the Etsy boards that in order to sell in different regions, you need to set up each listing according the delivery region:

  
""...  you have to set up a listing that ""ships from"" the USA, then put in the shipping profile only the countries that one ships to,

Set up the same item with a listing of ""ships from UK"" with only the countries that ships to

and another ""ships from"" Spain, and only the countries that ships to

and the other ""ships from"" Canada, and only the countries that one ships to""  


I'm very confused as to how that works in practice with a connected Printful account, especially in light of my first problem where Printful says our design isn't available in our sales region with no other regions as an option.   


Can anybody decode this for me? 😁 I've looked extensively through the Printful help articles but can't find anything that explains this.

Esty Sellers: how has your experience been selling Printful POD on Etsy? Would you recommend it?,1,1bh230s,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1bh230s/esty_sellers_how_has_your_experience_been_selling/,9,2024-03-17 23:42:44,"I have multiple Shopify stores and was thinking of setting up a POD shop somewhere. Don’t want to manage a 4th Shopify store. Amazon rejected me for a merch shop, so thought of Etsy as another option. I already use Printful with one of my Shopify stores. I’ve been happy with them so far.

I saw Etsy’s fees are pretty high. I’m used to paying only 3.5% + $0.30 transaction fees with Shopify.

Is Etsy more passive than a Shopify store? How has your experience been, and would you recommend someone open a POD Etsy shop with Printful?"
Shipping Costs killing me,4,1bgalbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1bgalbd/shipping_costs_killing_me/,17,2024-03-16 23:56:43,"Hi so i setup about 32 Items for my etsy store, and i got 3 orders and now i made about -40€. When creating a product you can offer free shipping and it will be accounted for in the price and added, THO ONLY USA.

I had 2 european customers and during a sale they purchased 3 items and printful charged about 15€ for shipping.

31,50 € Final Price (without the sale!), includes planned revenue  
17,75 € Printful Price  
15 € shipping fee!!!

i dont know if this is just me but to me this is hella annoying! etsy even has the option to set a shipping fee for every country, but do i have to manually edit every country for 32 products now?????

is there maybe a better alternative on how i can solve my problem"

I seriously hope someone with an extreme amount of experience will respond to this post that or someone who works directly at printful. I have over 1000 items to push to amazon.  I simply cannot get a single pair of shoes to auto sync from printful to amazon but I very well may be able to get them to through shopifys integration.

Look how thin the All-Over Print Recycled Unisex Mesh Shorts are. These are $24.

This is the thinnest fabric you can find. You can see through these shorts when the light hits and even when it doesnt.

The print quality came out great. Love the look. Nice fit too.

I like to sell products with free shipping on Etsy. So at a cost $24, I have no idea how a consumer would be wiling to pay around $35 for these. In my opinion, these shorts are worth no more than $20-$25 to the customer.

Or Printful needs to be an alternative pair that has an inner lining with a cost around $22-$26.

Am I off here? As a customer, would you pay $35 for these?

This is driving mad. Can you use a multi layer design done through printful on multi products without redesigning it each time?

I have a product, it’s a post card with some art then a layer of text done in the printful designer thing. I have a created a product template with the idea of then copying that design across to a mug and a poster and a t-shirt. I’ll be damned if I can figure out how to do this? 

If I create a new product by going to product catalog and recreate it then I get options down the right side to move the design onto a hoodie, t-shirt etc. but if I select a product from my product templates I don’t have this option? And I can duplicate the template but there is now “swap product” or “change product option”. I must be doing something wrong? 

I can go and click on an older product sync’d to my Etsy store and then edit the design but again there is no way to use the layers from that design to port to another product. I have to recreate it each time for using another on another product?"

Can you change the settings to reflect Printful turnaround time in ""Fulfillment Settings"" and not be out of compliance?

Mug Shipping from Charlotte,3,1axwwtg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1axwwtg,3,2024-02-23 17:01:24,"I’m freaking out a little bit here. 

I’ve been a very happy Printful customer for several months now - I even pay for Printful growth - but I’m about to pull the plug on all of it unless I can get to the bottom of this. I’ve sold well over a hundred mugs, most of which are fulfilled in Charlotte and shipped within the US, and just this week I’ve had my first two reports of broken mugs. One was an order with 2 mugs and the 20 oz broke. Another was an order with a 15oz mug and a hoodie, but they shipped separately (so that means it’s two separate items and not just a problem when there are multiple mugs on an order).

When the buyers send pictures, it looks like the mugs have just been put haphazardly into cardboard boxes with absolutely no padding at all. Before, when I’ve ordered samples, they were shipped in custom formed boxes that padded the mugs beautifully. Apparently that’s no longer a thing? 

Has anyone else been having this issue, especially in the last week or so?

Trouble with poster sizes!,0,1axv3lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1axv3lo/trouble_with_poster_sizes/,3,2024-02-23 14:55:22,"I am trying to make a poster but the problem is it won't perfectly or even semi-prefectly fit into the frame sizes printful is offering. I've already given up on the square posters as my design is horizontal or vertical but the ratios don't all work together. The transform option always locks the width and height. The only solutions I can think of are either unlocking the ratio which I can't find any info on (It seems this option is only for clothing not posters), or being able to upload a different image for each size ( this would be best). The problem with the latter is that when I try to resize my images externally uploading the 24' by 36' poster will automatically transform all the other poster sizes to hold the image that I specifically made for 1 poster. I hope that makes sense but the best option would be to upload a different photo for every size rather than have 1 which I have to resize to fit all."

First Samples Arrived! Questions…,3,1axdt50,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1axdt50/first_samples_arrived_questions/,15,2024-02-23 01:32:20,"Received first ever POD samples and pretty pleased overall. Planning on getting the store live within the week.

I have a few questions:

1) Have you had to deal with customers complaining about the vinegar smell? I know it washes out but how big an issue is this?

2) Does Printful fulfill from the facility closest to the buyer and also ship US orders from US facilities and Canadian orders from Canadian facilities?

3) If I am lucky to have a very successful marketing campaign, say 5000+ (spit-balling numbers) over the next 4 weeks, are there any concerns with processing & shipping lead times? At what point do I need to notify customers of potential delays beyond what’s considered “normal”?

4) Anything else I should know? What do you wish you would have known about before getting into POD or working with Printful?

Thank you and I hope everyone is having a successful POD day!

Pricing Items on Printful is So Difficult,2,1aqnxh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1aqnxh7/pricing_items_on_printful_is_so_difficult/,8,2024-02-14 21:18:27,"The price editing in Printful is so much more difficult than it has to be.

Instead of just being able to bulk edit everything in the shop to take in a certain percentage of profit, the only options are to either add/subtract a percentage to the number currently set, or to set the price directly. 

So, if I have some things set on 80% and others on 100%, and I want 150%, I would have to manually add 70 to the items currently set at 80%, and 50 to the ones set at 100%. I can't just universally set everything to take 150%.

Not only that, but if you set the percentage of profit you want to recieve, the numbers seem to randomly change by up to 10 percent when you go back in to check it. You set it to 150, then come back and it's 145.

Third thing is, when you bulk edit on printful, it only changes the 10 on viewbale items on the page. You have to go through each page and edit in groups of 10. Fine if you have 20 items, not so much if you have 7000.

Maybe I'm just being dumb and missing something, but no other platform I use makes setting prices this difficult. Eg, Redbubble - How much profit would would like to recieve per item? 150%. Done. All items set to recieive 150% profit from their base value. 

On Printful, instead of changing the percentage from it's base value,  eg, 100 to 150, all you can do is change it from the percentage that it's currently set to. You can't even just add 50 to 100 to make it 150, because it doesn't add 50% of the base value. It adds 50% of the of the base value + the original 100% added, which comes to a different number than 150% of base value. It's just a stupid way to edit prices. 

If you think I'm wrong about this, put up a new item and select decrease by 100% and keep clicking set. Printful, not only allows you to sell for no profit, but the system actually allows you make negative percentages. You can actually set you profit margin to -20,000%. Why would that be an option? Some shoddy developer has been working overtime. I don't want to have to calculate how to get to 250% from where it is. I just want to be able to type it and set it. All it takes is a one field entry. There's no need for stacking percentages on top of percentages."

Account Bans Using Printify with TikTok,0,1aiax87,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1aiax87/account_bans_using_printify_with_tiktok/,4,2024-02-04 07:37:59,"In a nutshell, a lot of people, including myself, are facing automatic bans on their accounts when using the Printify integration with TikTok. When I encountered this happened to me a week ago, I reached out right away to Printify. They told me that the problem is with TikTok and that they were already aware of the issue affecting numerous Printify users.

I escalated my case until I was able to speak with a manager at Printify. The manager asked for my TikTok shop code and forwarded it to TikTok's team, promising that I would receive an update via email. However, after waiting for a couple of days without any response, I decided to contact Printify again.

Printify told me that TikTok had been informed about the problem and that it had been resolved. Following their guidance, I attempted to appeal my ban on TikTok. When I spoke to TikTok's customer service, they explained that the ban was due to a discrepancy between my personal address and the warehouse address. They told me to appeal the ban and provide my personal documents, which I did. But as I knew it would, my appeal was denied.

Now, I have a 15-day window to submit a second appeal, but I'm fairly certain it will also be denied. I have tried explaining to 20 different TikTok representatives that Printify is a TikTok partner, and I won't be able to provide the warehouse address documents they are requesting. However, I continue to be advised to submit an appeal.

Has anyone else who has used the Printify and TikTok shop integration managed to recover their accounts successfully? If so, what approach did you take?"

I'm overwhelmed and clueless when it comes to the tax side of things. Do I need to register in every state if my volume is low?

Do I charge additional sales tax, or just factor it into my prices?

Should I just see how much I sell, save all proceeds, and then pay taxes on the tail end of things?

Can't imagine I'll do more than a couple thousand USD in sales, with a tiny portion of that being profit.

I'll give you a product example to better understand because English is not my first language 
I am planning to print my 6 design on a Mug.
So total will be 6 mugs each with different design but 6 is too little so I will be printing another 6 with a total of 12 mugs. Each 2 mugs share a Design of the 6.
OR
I am thinking of eliminating one of the designs so total will be 5 designs and instead of printing each design on 2 mugs I will print it on 3 mugs and total mugs will be 15. Each 3 mugs share a Design of the 5.

The thing is this is my first time joining a market like this so I am not even sure if people will be interested in buying my products. I am afraid that making 12 products would be too little and making 15 products would be too much.

I'm about to order my first samples of All-Over Print Recycled Unisex Zip Hoodie and Women's High Top Canvas Shoes.  


My question pertains to sizing - obviously there are size guides available, but I'm not sure how much to trust them.  I have my location and currency set as the UK, but my store is intended to ship all products worldwide (mainly so I can get the full extent of products and let the customer choose if they're willing to wait). I'm trying to order some samples so I can wear them myself if the quality is good enough.  


The shoes are pretty simple; I'm a size 8 in UK womens; they're womens shoes and I have no reason to believe the sizing in the guide would be for another country. So can I trust that to be accurate?  


The issue comes with my hoodie. Normally in most clothes I'm a Medium or Large, 14/16, depending on the brand. But according to the size guide, my measurements would put me at a 2XS, which I don't trust at all. Could it just be because I'm a women ordering unisex clothes and therefore I need to be lower down the spectrum? What would truly tiny women order if that sizing was accurate? I'm okay with some bagginess in my hoodies, so I'd rather order too big than too small, but I'm trying to replace a hoodie that is falling off me.  


 I messed up this exact thing with my last supplier so I'd like to avoid a repeat incident given the price and waiting time. Thanks in advance! :)"

I have been using printful to push product to amazon, Ebay, and the tiktok shop. I have not had any issues with tiktok or EBay but amazon integration has been excruciating to say the least. 

I have my amazon seller account set up for The u.s. Mexico and Canada and when I go to list a product it does not show the option for Canada or Mexico only the u.s. which is daunting to me because I will miss out on a large amount of potential revenue if I am unable to push products to all 3.

My only other issue has been with adding certain products to amazon. Shoes will not list to the u.s. Market but most other products so far will list fine after applying for a gtin exemption for those specific catagories.

I spoke with printful support and they acknowledged that the shoes not listing is an error on their end. 

Recently I cam across a store on amazon that had obvious printful listings for shoes and he explained that he manually created those listings. Ill admit a lot of this is very new to me. I am wondering if I create a manual listing for shoes will it then be able to sync with my printful dashboard after it is created? Also why and how do I get my mexico and canada stores to show up for printful.

I am pretty much pleading for help here.. I have 600 products I can potentially list to amazon and 200 listed so far.  If any staff at printful are reading this please can I speak with someone more directly. That can help me troubleshoot a few of these problems more closely.

I have worked close to 14 hour days on this for right at a month now and am extremely determined to turn this into something worthwhile I just desperately need a bit of guidance.  Thanks to all of you guys as well!"

I was recently experimenting with designs on different items and came across an issue with dark garments (t-shirts, hoodies, etc…). When I add my design to these products the colours come out really dull, and a pop up says that the print colour might be affected due to the white underbase.

I have done some research on white underbases, and have seen that it used to make the colours pop on black garments. I have also seen some printful designs on black t shirts and they have turned out fine.

I was wondering if it will actually turn out dull like the design says, or if it will turn out fine, and it is just what the t shirt will look like without the white underbase. 

I have looked all over the internet and have found no answers so if anyone could provide one it would be greatly appreciated.

We have better mechanisms available to us with signature verification which I have to imagine relative to the security win vs. effort is a high impact addressable issue.

Printful will print your graphic off-center and point to their DTG (direct to garment) process terms as being within their expected parameters. Check out the photos.   
 

I contacted Printful, and they essentially replied that they have every right to print your logo off center. No refunds.  
 

Here's their reply verbatim:   
 

""After looking at the photos, I can say the design placement is within our discrepancies. For the fulfillment, the human process is involved, which won't guarantee a 100% placement for every single print. With that being said, the placement discrepancy is from 0.5''-1'', so from the fulfillment side, the outcome is expected.""  
 

Looks like it’s more than 1” off from center. It's not even straight. But they’ll leave it to you to explain that to your customers and deal with any refunds they may want along with added return shipping costs.  
 

So keep that in mind if you decide to go with Printful for your logo."

I have changed shipping rates on my Squarespace website to be based on weight. This way I'm not charging $8 shipping on a sticker or a poster, but can collect that on something like a sweatshirt. **Any time there is more than 1 item, Squarespace doesn't register the second item**, and typically this is where my loss is at. They charge the customer $4.95, Printful charges me $12 and I'm in the red again.

I know there are international fulfilment locations but this seems the safest option. 

My question is am I being too cautious? It’s disappointing to not be able to sell more products. Do you find U.K. customers get asked for payments on delivery for products coming from Printful’s EU locations?"

Hello everyone.

Maybe this is not the best place to ask this but I have nothing to lose.

I found someone selling t shirts online and one of his best selling ones was a t shirt with the design ""The catfather"". The design had clearly ""The godfather"" font and logo and only changed the word.

Isn't this something that goes under copyright usage?

Like who will get an item from my shop that's 3 times more expensive than a bigger % of market leaders that sell the same stuff even if their design is worse. It seems nearly impossible to get some customers on your side, besides I dont understand how other people can price all that for such a low price like do people lose money on purpose to get customers for social proof or smthin?

Can knowledgeable folks please verify or correct?

Our home is in Michigan. We are selling framed and unframed posters. All will be fulfilled directly by printful to the customers, no warehouse, no sending to us and we sell them to customers. Our business is never going to grow large enough to have an economic nexus.

1. Printful will charge **us** sales tax on every customer order based on the amount of the printful cost to us of the order. We can register in Michigan and submit a resale permit to printful, and they will no longer charge **us** sales tax but only for sales to customers **in Michigan**. Printful will still charge **us** sales tax on our cost of orders to all other states (where they have nexus). Through a complicated and painful process it might be possible to also register for a resale certificate in other states.
2. We need to set up Shopify to charge sales tax for sales to shipping addresses in Michigan since we have a physical location here (our kitchen table where we set our laptops). Shopify will collect the sales tax, remit it to us, and provide us with a report of tax collected (quarterly? Annually?) We will be responsible for remitting the collected sales tax to the State of Michigan along with the correct tax form, even if the total tax is minimal.

How exactly does Printful expect their clients to make any money? Perhaps raise the price to 90$ a hoodie and scare off potential customers?

Printful seems more like B2C model rather than B2B. I say it’s more like B2C because it’s the kind of site you’d expect people to go on there once to purchase a custom shirt with their dog’s face on it and thats it.

Printful x Etsy Shipping Profile - How to offer free UK shipping?,3,18c4xf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/18c4xf9/printful_x_etsy_shipping_profile_how_to_offer/,1,2023-12-06 21:18:21,"I have set up my Etsy store and connected to Printful. At the moment I am using the shipping profiles that automatically pull through from Printful. I want to offer free UK and US shipping (I have added shipping costs into my RRP), but of course when I select free delivery in the shipping profile it reverts back to default every day when Etsy and Printful sync. 

How do I get around this? I want to duplicate the Printful shipping profile and adjust it but Etsy won't allow me to duplicate it. I have also tried setting up my own shipping profile but Etsy doesn't have an option for ""other"" shipping partner (i.e. Printful).

If I select a shipping partner at random, the delivery window doesn't match Printful so I don't want to do that. Has anyone else managed to get around this? 

I have also noticed that the prices on the Printful shipping profile that automatically pulls through to Etsy, don't match Printful's website...And I can't overwrite them.

Printful-Etsy Integration not marking orders complete on Etsy?

Is it normal for orders that are fullfilled on Printful to take several days (4+) to be marked as complete/shipped on Etsy? For some orders this isn't an issue because I can manually mark them complete with the tracking number. However, when Printful uses Pitney Bowes through USPS for shipping, the tracking number provided can't be used to manually complete the order on Etsy. I even had one case of this where the package was delivered before it was even marked as shipped on Etsy. I now have another order that isn't marked as complete on Etsy 4 days after being fulfilled and shipped.

I've talked to every level of customer support at Printful, Bluehost and SiteLock. Each one tells me to whitelist a certain IP or something else. It works for 1 week and then breaks again. Then I go back to the support, explain the whole issue again and that nothing has worked. They ""escalate"" the issue, then the higher level of support says ""sorry, but this isn't our fault and we can't help. It's actually Bluehost's or Sitelock's fault."" So, I go to those support networks and they say the same thing. I've been in this support black hole for a year and I'm done with it.

Does anyone have any idea of how to fix this issue? I'm already looking into canceling Sitelock, but thought I'd ask here before I do.

My business is technically Canadian, since my 'office' (home address) is in Canada. I sell **only** in the US, using Shopify + Printful. All fulfillment/product creation is through Printful. I noticed the following from my first few orders:

* Shopify does **not** charge any sales tax on any of my products. I tried changing settings, but can't figure it out.
* Printful **does** charge sales tax on my orders, which I pay—which makes profit margins very low.

Based on Canadian tax rules, I don't think I need to collect taxes since my revenue is under $30,000. 

Any advice?

Anyone have any luck with digital products?

Printful-Etsy Clarification on VAT for Orders Above Thresholds Fulfilled Within the EU and UK,1,17xga1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/17xga1b/printfuletsy_clarification_on_vat_for_orders/,0,2023-11-17 21:28:32,"Hi there,

I'm setting up a shop based in Switzerland on Etsy and integrating with Printful for fulfillment. I have some complex VAT-related questions for orders fulfilled and shipped within the EU and the UK respectively. I would appreciate any insights you can provide.

**Here's the scenario:**

* My store is in Switzerland (non-EU), and I’ll be using Printful, which has EU and UK fulfillment centers.
* For orders under €150 in the EU and under £135 in the UK, I assume Etsy would handle VAT collection appropriately based on their policies and my store location.
* However, for orders above these thresholds, there seems to be a potential VAT loophole. Etsy would not collect VAT at checkout, assuming customs duties will be applied, but since the orders are actually fulfilled within the EU/UK, they won’t go through customs.

**My questions for the community:**

1. How does Etsy/Printful handle VAT for orders above €150 in the EU and above £135 in the UK that are fulfilled within the respective regions but sold from a non-EU/UK-based store like mine?
2. Has anyone else encountered this situation in either the EU or the UK? If so, how did you manage VAT collection to ensure compliance?

Printful's response indicated that Etsy wouldn’t know the fulfillment location at the time of the order, suggesting this VAT issue might indeed arise. I’m looking to understand how best to navigate this and ensure accurate VAT application for my EU and UK customers.

Thank you in advance for your help and advice!"

2024 wall calendar shipping costs?,3,17turdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/17turdb/2024_wall_calendar_shipping_costs/,3,2023-11-13 04:49:32,"Not exactly a ""rant"", but is it really true that the 2024 wall calendar is $12.95, but the shipping costs for one calendar are $13.50? For the second one, it's $5.50 which is fair.

I think $13.50 quite a bit high, considering the lower price of the calendar (and shipping cost for a t-shirt is $4.69).

Can somebody please give some insights on how this high shipping rate is appropriate? Or is it a mistake?"
Honest Blunt Feedback,10,17tc7lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/17tc7lv/honest_blunt_feedback/,6,2023-11-12 11:08:09,"As someone who’s on and off used Printful for a few years now for merch I’d like to give my honest review for possible noobies debating if they would like to go the Printful route. 

Nutshell,

Pros: Quality of products and prints for numerous items are usually very good! Ease of use, website integration and of course not having to do fulfillment/shipping makes it super nice.

Cons: the biggest one for me is product cost and shipping costs sometimes being outrageous.

Pros in depth: Nearly every product I’ve ever sold I order a sample to ensure my customers will receive a quality product, each and every time I’ve done this the product has been top notch quality. For most popular website hosts it is super easy to integrate Printful in the back end so orders automatically get sent over to Printful from your website which makes things super hands free. As an artist who is in different states/cities numerous days of the week I’m simply too busy to do stock, fulfill and ship orders so the ease of using Printful makes things a breeze for me.

Cons in depth:
the cost in some styles/design placements can sometimes be double or even TRIPLE in comparison to working with manufacturers directly (obviously this is where Printful is making a large chunk middle-manning) My next biggest gripe is the shipping cost, as someone who’s been selling merch, fulfilling orders and shipping items myself some of the shipping on items is once again double or even TRIPLE the rate of shipping it yourself with a label printer. For instance: my now fiancé ordered a backpack from my website, I used the suggested price margin and I ended up losing $20 due to the hidden costs of digitization (which is almost always a scam, it’s just turning your design into an SVG file… you can do this online for free btw), then the outrageous shipping cost they tacked on. I ended up being able to see how they shipped it, they used an overly sized box (could’ve comfortably fit 5-6 of the backpacks in this one box for ONE backpack) which could’ve easily fit in a polybag and shipped out for $4-$6 since when I weighed it, it was under 16oz to utilize ground (2-3 days). They charged $18 for shipping this. Personally felt robbed and also feel printful needs to be more upfront with shipping cost and would suggest them putting that into the cost section when you are setting your retail price (instead of giving you unrealistic profit margins) In a nutshell, that first week of me releasing numerous merch items I netted roughly -$150 before I was able to catch what was going on. I would highly suggest triple checking prices of things before fully launching items with the impression of having good margins. 

Would I recommend Printful?
Maybe in some very niche circumstances, yes but if you have time and $ to work with manufacturers and ship things yourself I’d suggest going that route for better prices all around."

I don’t want the sides to be bare of artwork or off center but i’m wondering if the framing shows the side of the canvas? or if my design covers partially, but not all of the dotted ‘side and back’ space will you see that? or does print full crop the design of framed canvases to only be the front? I’ve looked up so many reviews and can’t seem to figure it out which is very frustrating. i’m thinking i might only be able to use some of my designs for canvas prints if the design must wrap all the way around the canvas because i don’t want the design to be cut off from wrapping the canvas. ugh so stressed i hope someone can help! thanks!"

What size of poster to try printing on with photos that are 3088 x 2048.,1,17pidf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/17pidf7/what_size_of_poster_to_try_printing_on_with/,1,2023-11-07 08:00:13,"Hey!

I plan on using a print on demand service to sell my photography in the form of a poster. The thing I'm not sure is the dimensions. More specifically, what size poster I could use for the photography files that I have.

My photos are 3088 x 2048.

From what I gathered by searching online, for images that are 3088 x 2048, it would be best not to print a poster that is 16""x20"" or bigger. I thought of asking here if anyone would know if this is right, or if there is another poster size that I shouldn't exceed.

I plan on ordering a few to see how they look before making any final decision. I thought of asking people's opinion here as a way to see what sizes I could try out before actually ordering any.

The store is a one product store. 

The product allows for users to upload an image, and enter some text, then proceed to checkout. Once checkout is complete, under the hood, printful should use this image and text and apply it to a product template in my account and create and fulfill the order. I don't want a live preview like with Zepto but just simply upload image, enter text, and add to cart.. no live preview or anything.   


I am not a developer but have hired 2 different developers now who do not know how to achieve this. Should I use a different print on demand company? Is it that tricky to do this with printful? Any devs here who have done this specific thing? I am not sure in which direction to go anymore.

Normally I go ahead and edit the fulfillment times manually in Etsy for longer, but when someone makes a purchase/I add more listings it goes right back to the 2-5 business days. I was wondering if I can just change this on Printful so I don’t have to back and manually edit everytime?

If a product is unavailable, this isn't clear through their ordering system and their algorithm will automatically ship the product from a fulfillment center in the US (or internationally), and you'll get hit by huge duty and duty tax fees. This just happened to me this past week.

For example, I ordered from Hamilton, Ontario which is 70km away from their Toronto fulfillment center, instead, they shipped the product from North Carolina which is 1220km away. So their algorithm hasn't been optimized for Canadian customers. I paid over 40% more for my order once duty fees were applied, and felt sick about the cost on the planet in terms of emissions of fossil fuels being burned to ship me a box of t-shirts at such a great distance. Part of the reason I use print-on-demand is to have less of a carbon footprint since there is less textile waste. But this experience leads me to believe they don't share the same values. Profits first. 

Truly disappointed since I was fairly happy with the products and the website seemed straightforward/easy to use. The margins aren't great, but the ease of use was worth it for now until I figure out if I want to continue selling products. Now I feel like a fool for using Printful. I have spent hours of my time asking Printful to make this right, and they refused, so that's why I'm spreading the news about my experience. 

I'm an artist, not a big company or influencer... and I'd hate for this to happen to someone else because this issue cost me so much $. :("
Parameterized Fulfillment Requests: Creating Sync Product Variants on the Fly,1,17mu6x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/17mu6x0/parameterized_fulfillment_requests_creating_sync/,0,2023-11-03 19:41:10,"Hi Printful API users & devs,

running an online store integrated with Printful for fulfillment, I'd like to know if the following (A) is at all possible, and if so then how to generally go about it:

*(A)     When a customer issues an order at my shop, and the shop would issue a fulfillment request to Printful, I want that request to include user-defined parameters (f.e. color values). The parameters should then be used to create an individualized sync product variant on the fly which is then used for fulfillment.*

As a fallback to the above I already researched (and partially achieved) the following (B), however even here I ran into roadblocks that make me wonder if I am not going about this the wrong way:

*(B)     When a customer adds a user-customizable item to their cart at my shop, my shop would spawn a new individualized store product, make calls to Printful API to create and configure a corresponding sync product variant for fulfillment (again, based on user-defined parameters) and then add that product to the cart, ready to be ordered.*

Thanks in advance for any thoughts."

I ordered my first sample from Printful and the shipping label said “Production officer/Fulfillment Center” 

When someone orders from my store, will it say that? Or will it say my shop’s name? 

I HATE seeing “fulfillment center” or anything similar on the label. Why is it so hard to have the shop’s name? Especially after asking for the information….

If I update the shipping profile on Etsy to add 2 more days to account for weekends, it reverts back through the Printful integration.

I have a couple of questions I need help with regarding shipping. Context: I am making a ecommerce with Shopify and already have made integrations with Printful and doing designs as we speak. One thing that is itching my head is the shipping part. So my target audience mainly is in Finland and Europe buts lets focus first on Finland: my designs are shipped from Latvia, Spain and UK (mainly Latvia).

Question 1: How is the shipping actually working? Does it ship from Latvia from a certain carrier (DHL? UPS? Who?) to Finland and in here is it the local companies?
Question 2: Where do they ship it? If my customers put their homeaddress, does it ship always there, or in some local post office / post box etc?
Question 3: I can integrate via different apps a way to let the customer choose the closest postal office / place for picking up the package based on the address location they put in there. If they lets say put an address in central of Tampere, and it would offer a post locker as the pickup location, does Printiful send in to the mentioned locker, or the persons home address, or somewhere else?

I want to make the checkout look clear and work flawless and the shipping part is my, well actually the only weak point how to make things work the proper way. And yes, I have already set my own flat rates for shipping payments.

Thanks in advance!"

Apologies in advance if I’m being a total dingus. I’m really struggling with printful and can’t seem to find any videos that help me in the ways I need it to. 

Im basically not finding printful to be very intuitive. I have a poster designed with a few colour variants. I also want to make this available in around 5 different size options. 

When I try to upload these, I just can’t find an intuitive way to do it, such as selecting ‘add new product’, then selecting the sizes I want and adding each appropriate file to each design. It doesn’t seem to have that as an option or doesn’t make it clear if it is. It appears to be one file applied to all selected sizes. When I add variants via Etsy and return to printful, it’s only showing two variants instead of three regardless of if I refresh data. 

Short of adding every single version as it’s own product, I can’t find a way of doing this at all, let alone easily. Obviously I’d rather my products all appear under a single listing where a customer can choose size and colour option, but I just can’t figure it out. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

*These are in addition to P+P costs paid to ship your items. Customers in the EU are now 'importing' items from the UK and legislation dictates that tariffs and taxes must be applied when goods enter the EU market from the UK.*

*You can expect to pay a 20% VAT charge on your total shipment a 12% Customs Duty along with an additional courier handling fee.*

We're aware that the OSS came live in July 2021. However, after much reading, it's still not clear. 

- Do we need to charge just 21% VAT for orders delivered to Spain or Latvia and the rest of EU countries (including our own) 0% VAT?
- Do we need to charge our country’s VAT rate to all intra-EU transactions?

I managed to make everything work excepting those 2 problems I would like to resolve:

\- Is it possible to update multiple product variants in one API call? In exemple, sending an array of variants.  
Right now it seems I have to do one API call for each variant (20 API calls in total, for one product !). As the API call are limited to 10 per minute, I would like to get rid of this ""Too many requests"" error, just for one T-shirt with only 4 colors + 5 sizes.

\- When I upload (by API) an image file to a variant, it seems that Printful automatically use the whole print area on the T-shirt, which is too big for me. How can I send the print dimensions at the same time as the image file, to my image won't cover the T-shirt almost entirely, but let's say, 50% of it ?

So there's no option to alter that. And then when I attempt to place an order through my TikTok shop it says that the chosen item is not stocked in the selected region.

But it is stocked in the selected region when I order it through my Shopify. I reached out to TikTok about this and all they kept telling me was that TikTok only allows sales to take place in the US and they will only ship to the US.

Then they told me that they were going to escalate my issue and it's so reach out to me in 24 to 48 hours and that was a week and a half ago.

Hi everyone,

I'm currently working on a project using the Printful API and have run into a small roadblock that I'm hoping some of you can help me with. I'm fetching product details from an endpoint (example: https://api.printful.com/store/products/319962139  
) to get information about a Hoodie that comes in 42 different variants and 6 different colors.

The issue is that I can't seem to get the color information for all the variants directly from this endpoint. I can get variant IDs and use them to fetch the color, but it feels incredibly inefficient to make a separate request for each color. That's 6 different requests just for color info!

**My Questions**:

1. Am I using the wrong endpoint for this?
2. Is there a way to batch these requests or fetch all the color information in one go?
3. Is this just how the Printful API is designed, or am I missing something?

I'd appreciate any help or insights you can provide. Thanks in advance!"

1) When I try to save my template the system won't let me save it because ""something is wrong with one of your products"". I have to save a draft and then go check my store  (nothing is wrong there) and go back to editing the draft and then I can save it. This happens if I try to create a template from the Products templates.

2) When making a template by going to the editor via Product Catalog, it lets me save the template but the product template listing takes forever to update (which means I cannot download mockups at all) unless I go somewhere else and then return to the listing. It then won't let me add the item to the store. I get to the first view where you'd proceed to mockups but no further. Sometimes making a duplicate of the template works and you can add the duplicate, sometimes not.

With such designs i would love to get personalized mock ups that show that! So i go to the mock-up creator, custom mock-ups, and finally ""mock-up styles"" where I have to choose between ""flat - handle to the right"" ""Lifestyle - Handle to the right"" etc! There are only 4 options! What I need is something that would be called ""Flat - front"" . Just the mug, frontal plane, no background ( so I can choose the background after in the personalization ) . How do I do that ? The frontal lifestyle theme printful gives on the ""mock-up styles"" is the worse combination possible for my style of designs. Any help would be appreciated!"
Printful still showing 50% off?,1,16hiay7,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/16hiay7/printful_still_showing_50_off/,3,2023-09-13 16:22:09,"Hi! Just made my first product and listed it on my shop however all the products in the catalog still show with the 50% discount. So just to clarify - the discount applies to the first order that is made? So if I were to make second product now with the same discount how does it work? If product A gets an order first then the product B goes to the original price? And does the product A stay in the discounted price for all orders made for it or just the first one?

See the screenshots (basket at Etsy and Printful). Additionally totally different Shipping fees (in Printful much higher), I use the shipping profiles from Printful.  
I asked Printful directly why they charge VAT and Etsy not. They didnt know that. I later found that [https://www.etsy.com/seller-handbook/article/1014946249688](https://www.etsy.com/seller-handbook/article/1014946249688?fbclid=IwAR3CrceYfXS7I_uga3GQkHj0-PCaDFLXWpS8ETIC0tnlpjyzEuSI75C3s-c)

Printful has been so difficult to use that I am giving up,1,16denp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/16denp2/printful_has_been_so_difficult_to_use_that_i_am/,9,2023-09-08 23:09:05,"I started working with Printful several months ago and I would have dozens of products listed on Etsy right now if not for the confusing and unintuitive nature of the website.

The website suffers from two common maladies:

1) It is apparently created by engineers who are so familiar with the site that they've completely forgotten what it looks like to new users trying to learn it.

2) They are so hungry for more of my business that they're constantly inserting ads into every step of the design process, which is distracting and annoying.

EXAMPLE: 

I'm trying to design a bumper sticker.  Literally at every step there is a lack of clarity and a bunch of distractions.  

I search for ""bumper sticker"" (one of the most common kinds of sticker on the planet) and there are no search results.  Okay... so I pick the option that looks the most like a bumper sticker and start designing.   It says it's a ""kiss cut"" sticker?  I'm new.  I don't know what that means.  Is it explained anywhere?  No, of course not. But it looks like a rectangle so I roll with it and start designing.  

Writing text on the sticker is easy enough, but how do I change the background color?  This is something that should be clear and obvious but totally isn't.  As I'm looking all over the page, clicking various unnamed buttons trying to find it, my frustration grows.  Instead of finding help I see  a bunch of ads telling me to put my bumper sticker design on coffee cups and tee shirts, etc.  

And this happens continually.  Every time I've made some progress, instead of seeing the next step I am bombarded by marketing for other projects on Printful. How about one thing at a time?  Instead of trying to sell me ten other products before I've finished my first one, how about helping me finish the first one?  

So I eventually give up on the background color and transition to the next step and that's when I see that the text is cut out instead of being on a rectangular sticker.  Is that what ""kiss cut"" means? Why wasn't that shown before?  How do I make a motherflipping bumper sticker?  Is it even possible?  I've spent 45 frustrating minutes and I still don't know the answer to this most basic question.

I did go to the help section of the site where there are video tutorials but before I can watch the first video I am required to take a quiz?  Are you freaking kidding me?  I come here for help, feeling confused and exasperated with the opaqueness of the site and the *first thing* I have to do is take a *test*?  I have to answer questions that I obviously don't know the answers to because I don't have permission to watch the tutorial before I take the test?  

Now extrapolate.  

This is the ""intelligence"" behind the entire website.

There is something seriously wrong with a website that forces me to leave the site constantly to search Google and Youtube for answers, just to understand the most basic functions of the site.  The fact that there are so many lengthy tutorials on Youtube is a sign of the failure of the site to fulfill it's fundamental purpose: to make it easy for people to design and list lots of products so we can all make money.

Fingers crossed Printify is a little better."
Double check EVERYTHING,4,16bsuvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/16bsuvy/double_check_everything/,11,2023-09-07 02:06:13,"So I submitted a large order. One of my designs was slightly off center, I mean slightly. I didn't notice right away because the mockup they use to show the end result is not forward facing completely. 

I always check my designs meticulously before printing. Like looking over every single inch. 

When I noticed something looked off on the mockup I opened a chat with them just to make sure I wasn't seeing things or maybe it was the model being slightly turned. Sure enough the file was off center. A perfectly round circle design. They printed it. 21 Tshirts printed off center. They are not sellable. 

I just feel like as a design person if I saw that and logically knew it was supposed to be centered I would put the order on hold and ask instead of just sending it to print. Maybe that's just me. 

Anyway, end of rant. Apparently double checking isn't enough, I need to triple check. 
So sick to my stomach.

EDIT to add:
Any suggestions on what I can do with the Misprints? I don't want to just trash them bc that feels so wasteful and it's a lot of money to have 21 shirts printed. 
I don't mind donating them but would rather try to recoup some of the lost money since I now have to have them reprinted."

I also tried going into my store and the closest thing I found was setting up alternatives; but, I don't think they will run out of the first option.  


Is there an easy way to go into an existing template, replace the product type, and keep the design exactly the same in the first template? Or, do I need to setup the template all over again?

I got in touch with the support staff and they told me that it was due to the DPI being too high, and that it should be in the recommended 150-300 DPI range. In any case, they were extremely nice and offered to give me a full refund for this.

For that, I am truly thankful! I would not have expected i) The high DPI to cause the cracking/peeling/blurring of the print on the products and ii) For this to be the outcome/resolution for my case.

Nevertheless, I am making this post for anyone who is starting their business and doesn't end up making the same mistake as I did. Maybe having too much DPI is also not a good thing.

Finally - I launched my store today and guess what - I got my first sale! I'm so happy! I know it's not a big deal but I worked on this constantly for a long time and seeing this sale really made me happy.

I wash like I wash my other clothes, and I never have problems with other shirts with even complex graphics printed on them. My Printful shirts have 1 color designs on them, with fine detail on some (the nature image shirts with animals and such), and less-fine detail on the word shirts (where the font glyphs don't have that fine of lines).

I wash on cold and dry in the dryer like any other clothes. Turning them inside out doesn't help. Am I doing something wrong or is the printing technique faulty? Is this problem unique to Printful or to any DTG printing service? I asked Printful customer support about this and they shut me down basically, saying ""if these shirts are older than 30 days we can't do anything"". Well of course, I don't wash my clothes more than once a week, so it's definitely going to be longer than a month. People can leave reviews about your clothes when they first get them on Etsy and the like, ""oh wow these shirts are amazing!"" but then unfortunately after just a little wear/washing, they end up with [this](https://i.imgur.com/AFtOJAs.jpeg).

_Any way this can be avoided?_ I have ordered over 40 sample shirts over the past 3-4 years, as I love to wear the shirts, but I have to buy a new one after ~3 washes because it looses so much of the print (it rubs off). No customer is going like this obviously, so I had to shut down my idea. Would like to bring it back if it's possible to avoid. I use the ""Unisex Basic Softstyle T-Shirt | Gildan 64000"" and ""Unisex Lightweight T-Shirt | Gildan 980"" shirts, because they are the right shape and durable, but yeah the designs immediately rub off.

Everything else with Printful has been great! They deliver on time and deliver the right thing in my experience, and the website is fairly easy to use. But this is a blocker to adoption for sure."

Horrible Quality Print (Peeling off/Cracking),3,163k1ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/163k1ax/horrible_quality_print_peeling_offcracking/,19,2023-08-28 18:52:53,"Hi guys.

Ordered samples for my new business that I will be launching soon to make sure the product quality and print are fine and I could validate it myself.

Unfortunately, the quality I received is just... bad! The design is cracked/peeling off, looks chunky and moreover, also looks kinda blurry.

I am working with graphic designers so every design I have used has been properly vetted and has a minimum DPI of around 600 and some go up to 1000-1200.

Do you have any advice for me? I would really not prefer to launch my store if the quality is sub-standard.

P.S. I used to work for a fashion brand before, and they used Printful as well - not that many issues with print quality and the design. What product variant should I use to print? Specifically, for t-shirts, sweaters and hoodies? I'm honestly a bit bummed. I get that Printful provides a good cost and I understand their policies well - I'm just trying to see how I can create a balance between that and providing my prospective clients decent quality merch that doesn't feel like it was drop-shipped from far away for a few bucks.

Honestly, if it was me, I would wear it as they are just samples. But if I paid good money for it, then I would not be satisfied with this type of quality. I really hope that it is just a one-off case and I got unlucky. Or maybe because of the specific location it was created/dispatched from.

I've attached a couple of images here!

Any advice/tips are appreciated. Thank you for your time to do this, it really helps!

How to communicate with your customers without spamming basic promotions,1,162hz5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/162hz5g/how_to_communicate_with_your_customers_without/,0,2023-08-27 12:45:53,"Hello!

 Its easy to just do the bare minimum when it comes with B2C direct marketing. But please, don't be that brand owner that only contacts your customers when there's a sale. All this does is guarantee a slow decline in your open rates and interest in your brand. Keep your emails interesting and fresh. From my experience there's only 2 reasons why anyone opens a branded email; they're either   
curious about what's inside or the think that the content of the email will benefit them somehow. I put this post together too give you some idea's for campaigns that you can send that aren't just basic sales.

  
Here are 10 newsletter ideas:  
  
**The thank-you email** \- plain text, keep it simple. I made an entire post about why this is the most powerful email you can possibly send earlier. If the didn't see that post, here's the short version. I sent out hundreds of emails for brands in completely different niches and there was one email that outperformed everything. It was a plain text email from the ""CEO"" that had a humble tone and just thanked customers for supporting the business.  
  
**The product highlight email** \- No discount needed. Pick an interesting product with good social proof and good reviews, then talk to the customer about what makes the product unique. Compliment your claims with social proof.  
  
**The review request** \- This could be implemented into a flow or directly sent to repeat customers as a newsletter. Not many people will send you detailed reviews unless you ask, incentivize, and tell them what you're looking for.  
  
**The Q&A email** \- Could be a survey, could just be a question snuck into other campaigns. The goal is to ask important questions. When you receive the answer you boost your domain health and gain some data. For example, on a streetwear brand: ask clients about what they want to see next. On a candle brand: get them to vote for the next scent. On a fitness brand: ask about their fitness goals etc.  
  
**Niche educational email** \- give out educational niche-relevant information. This is great for stores that have a blog or cross-post a lot on social media. Teach them about something they are interested in learning.  
  
**The holiday email** \- Aside from Ecom holidays like BFCM, you should also reach out to them on regular holidays. Regardless of if you want to run a holiday promotion or not, at least wish your customers a happy holiday.  
  
**The video campaign** \- make a video of yourself, post it, and link it into an email. Screenshot the video and use it as an image in the email. This is a very personal way to interact with your customers, and it gets them to engage with you on another platform like YouTube or Instagram. When you make this video campaign remember to keep them quick, interesting, and informative. Once they leave the original email, the competition gets fierce; you're now competing for attention against fast-paced Instagram reels and TikToks.  
  
**The funny email** \- don't even try to be professional. A lot of the time you can throw people off and get a reaction by simply being unprofessional and saying things they wouldn't expect you to say. If you're actually a funny person, you can see insane results with these emails in plain text. If you're not the best at coming up with this kind of stuff, just cross-post memes and funny niche-relevant posts from social media.  
  
**Giveaway/Interactive incentive discount** \- Give a discount or a reward in a fun way. Code a wheel of fortune with a ""random"" discount onto your site or set up a giveaway of something you know your customers would be excited about. This is better than just giving a standard discount because it incorporates an element of chance. It gets customers to go to your site without having any intention of buying that day. This traffic still holds value because now you get 2 chances to convert them, once via email and once when they actually get on your giveaway landing page.  
  
**Storytelling email** \- this type of email is literally gold. This is one of the most effective emails because you can connect with your customer's emotions. Whether it's your own personal story or a niche-relevant story you've found online, you can use the story to connect with your customers. You can even break down stories into multiple emails; you can have a huge promotion and sneak in a much-anticipated part 3 to last week's story. Always remember, emotion sells.

Once again, thanks for reading my post. I hope you got something out of it. If you have other ideas for email/sms campaigns, feel free to share below.

Question for EU-based businesses selling to the UK,2,1613hnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1613hnw/question_for_eubased_businesses_selling_to_the_uk/,1,2023-08-25 23:08:56,"So we're a EU-based company, looking to open a shop using Printful. We've been investigating taxation issues to make sure we got a handle on things before we open, and we're confused about the taxation Printful makes for orders shipped to and/or fulfilled in the UK. 

On this [nifty table](https://www.printful.com/uk/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-selling-internationally#h-taxes) on their blog, Printful says the tax base for orders to the UK is the Printful price (not the retail price).  From this, I assumed they were invoicing our company and charging us VAT for the products... but in that case, it wouldn't make sense that they would charge us 20%, since that's not the VAT rate in our country. 

Another explanation (and one that seems more likely from [Printful's help page](https://help.printful.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408221934738-How-does-Printful-charge-VAT-in-the-UK-)), is that they charge VAT to the final client (over the retail price) and remit it for us to the HMRC. If that is the case, I guess it works a bit like Norway, and we wouldn't need to sign up for a UK VAT ID, as the VAT is already taken care of.

Or... maybe something else entirely is happening and I don't get it. 😅

If you have a business in the EU that ships to the UK, please share your experiences, so that I can try to understand what happens when an order is sent there.

I was wondering if any of you could guide me a bit. I am trying to print few photos I took (never done it before). I know I need to export them at 300dpi, 100% quality, JPEG and sRGB. I have them on Lightroom.

Here's where I am stuck. I need to print these photos at 20x30inch. I know I need to resize the files and put them on a template they provided me in a .psd file to make sure I get the best quality. 

When I paste the photo exported from Lightroom to Photoshop, how do I make sure the quality is not getting reduced? Do I need to import the photo with any settings? When I resize the photo what should I do with it?

Exporting from Lightroom, then importing to Photoshop and then exporting again, would I lose a lot of quality here? Is there an easier way or more effective way to do this?

Sales Tax for Different States,3,15uu256,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/15uu256/sales_tax_for_different_states/,8,2023-08-19 02:36:22,"Hi all,

I've been reading through posts in this sub and a lot of research in general on sales tax. My understanding is that if I have nexus in a particular state (doing business from, having the address registered as, more sales, etc) I should register and apply for a reseller/sales tax permit so that Printful would not charge me sales tax.

I'm a sole proprietor right now, using Square as the storefront and connecting Printful to Square to fulfill order. My problem is that I currently live in Minnesota, but have California listed as the address for the store (but there is no physical store - that's just my home address). I am however moving to Colorado at the end of October - so very soon. The store/business is not live yet - I wanted to resolve this issue before starting so I don't have to pay sales tax to Printful. Square also does a weird auto tax calculator but I guess this is not the sub to ask about that part.

I'm assuming if I apply for sales tax permits from California and Minnesota, I would also have to file taxes in both states, which I currently don't do for California because I don't have income from there. I am thinking if it would be easier to just wait until I move to Colorado, then apply for the sales tax permit from Colorado and send it to Printful to be exempt. Is my thinking correct? I also don't expect a huge sales number - most of them WOULD BE from Minnesota and California.

This has all been very confusing, so any insight/help would be appreciated!"

White Printing on Black Tees,7,15nks7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/15nks7i/white_printing_on_black_tees/,27,2023-08-11 01:47:34,"Hi all,

I know this subject has been broached here a few times but I have some additional questions about printing white on Black Tees.

I'm going to be launching a store in the next week or so and the majority of my shirts have white designs on black tees. I read that there is an issue with the white cracking due to DTG printers only using one layer for white. User u/instantstar56 mentioned a useful hack of printing white areas in a very light grey to force Printful to do a second layer. Makes sense. They recommended hex code DCD6E9.

I've changed the white in my design to  DCD6E9, but it looks noticeably purple on my monitor and I'm concerned about what the print will look like. Does anyone have experience using this method (photos would be helpful). The design in question also has red text close to the white that makes the purple stand out. Could I just use a light grey that doesn't have a hint of color such as E9E9E9, or maybe a light grey with a hint of red in this instance?

Another tip I read is that you can Duplicate your print file layer within the Printful design studio and Printful will double print the layers. Does anyone know if this works or does Printful flatten the layers into one image prior to printing? I've read conflicting info.

I've tried to set up some designs for mugs on a number of platforms. However despite all settings being set to GBP, it shows the listing in USD for the ebay shop alone.

We have gone through the billing and done the more obvious fixes but are still struggling

Hope you're well,

So I'm an etsy seller using printful as my POD partner 

I'm trying to sell specifically to the USA only, from the UK. However my listing appeared in the UK etsy search when I searched for it on another device, so it got me thinking how many other countries can see my listings.

I've got my 'selling region' set as USA, in settings > stores and under ""Set your store's default selling preference"".

And also got my 'selling region' in ""global default selling preferences"" set as USA so I'm  only pushing products to my store that I can sell in the USA.

Am I doing something wrong, is there another setting or something that I need to do, that I'm missing?

Or does it have something to do with my settings on my Etsy store over on Etsy, in which case, I could make a post on the r/EtsySellers subreddit?

Thanks in advance, any help is appreciated."
Selling from UK to USA because of UK consumer protection thing,1,15ifalf,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/15ifalf/selling_from_uk_to_usa_because_of_uk_consumer/,9,2023-08-05 06:20:13,"Hi All, 

Hope you're well,

A bit confused so was hoping someone could help me out.

So a bit of background. I have a shop on Etsy with printful as my POD partner, and I'm selling to the USA only, from the UK.
 
The reason for this is basically that consumer protection law in the UK which I think, PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong, contradicts printful's policy of returns (i.e. customers can't return a product out of customers remorse, etc, only if the product is faulty, misprinted etc).
So just selling to the USA is easier so I don't need to worry about whether that law applies to me or not (better safe then sorry sort of thing).

So my question is, am I right in thinking that, or do i have the protection thing confused and dont really understand it?

If the second one, can someone explain it to me as simply as possible please?

Thank you in advance."

In most cases, the two sets of info are not even close to matching... it's really apples to oranges... some discrepancies as large as 8""! These issues are most prevalent with AOP garments, but definitely exist in other garments as well.

This practice is unethical at best, and most likely illegal in the US. Please help me (us) in demanding that Printful update this info, and work to accurately depict their product sizing on the customer facing size charts.

You can do this by being relentless in your pursuit of refunds/reshipments for incorrectly-sized garments. Don't take ""no"" for an answer.

Unfortunately, I can't seem to find a way to edit the size names on Printful or Etsy. Does anyone know a way to edit them, or some sort of workaround by manually creating or syncing products somehow?

Thank you in advance for any assistance!

Edit: If I change the size drop-down under Variations on Etsy to Inches, it adds ""Inches"" to the end which is not my preference because then to include the aspect ratio or any other details I would need each variation to say ""(4:5) 8x10 Inches"" where I would much prefer to put the aspect ratio or any other details after ""8x10 Inches"" rather than in front.

Update from Printful support:

""Currently, this is a limitation we have with Etsy and our Developer team is actively working on a solution, although at the moment there is no ETA on when this issue will be fixed. So at the moment, there wouldn't be any workaround for this besides adding a disclaimer to the product description regarding the measurements of the posters.""

I contacted Printful support and they said it's normal for them to resize the image due to the hoodie's pocket.  There was plenty of room for an 8.5x11"" image with the pocket but they said it's because the online template is for an extra large hoodie and the white space gets scaled with the image.  In other words, the image will get shrunk so the size remains relatively the same for each shirt size.  I asked why the image got squished to a different aspect ratio and they said they are free to resize as they see fit and will not give refunds if customers are not satisfied on how they resize it.  

Is this normal?  Can someone give me guidance on how Printful resizes and how I am able to get the exact size I want without it being all distorted from their resizing?  I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars trying to figure out how they'll decide to resize my image.  "

I am currently working on a website using Shopify that will include a Print on Demand Store (my art prints will be printed via Printful), but I am stuck in a bit of a weird dilemma

I am wanting to give a 30% merch shop discount to donors to a crowdfunding campaign on Ko-fi as an incentive and thank you gift for helping me cover startup costs for the website, but I am afraid of marking up my full prices too high to the point that no one would be willing to pay full price. But at the same time, if I don't mark them up high enough, the discounts would result in a loss. So far, doing the math, I am needing to have at least a 50% markup in order to just prevent losses during a 30% sale (sales tax is an absolute bitch in my area).

Any advice?"

Like, it said ""picking"" was completed, but just hasn't moved on to the next step in the process. For 3 weeks. I reached out to Printful over a week ago and they said they they'd put it on rush, but... over a week later, and still, just ""picking completed"" and it hasn't moved on to the next step. I emailed them again saying the item just seemed to be lost, and you can't rush something that doesn't exist anymore, and they said they'd contact the fulfillment center for an answer. 

That was a few days ago, I haven't heard back, and now I'm seeing my only other crew neck order since then was ""picked"" 5 days ago and *also* hasn't moved. I honestly just need to cancel these orders and pull these sweaters from my shop if everything is going to take a month, but I obviously don't want to be cancelling orders on customers + I really do like having the item available. 

So I just need to temp check: is this happening to anyone else? I would imagine they were backed up on embroidery orders, but I have embroidered hats shipping out fine super consistently - do they seem backed up on embroidered apparel orders to anyone? Does it seem like it really did get lost and the other one is just a coincidence that it's taking a while?

Resale Certificates & How To Deal With Printful's Taxes?,5,14v2tso,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/14v2tso/resale_certificates_how_to_deal_with_printfuls/,10,2023-07-09 23:27:27,"Hey guys,

I just started a Shopify with Printful and was pleasantly surprised to see good success. As we all know, Printful's prices are high and I've had to make my store's prices very high to adjust for this. But when I tried to calculate my true profit for the first week, I saw that I had barely made anything due to Printful's taxes.

I pay tax on every item I buy on Printful, but my customer doesn't. I do not want to bake these fees into my store's price as then the prices would seem absurd, I would much rather have each individual customer just pay the tax and that go directly to Printful.

I messed with my tax settings and added TaxJar to Shopify, and I see that my store is now charging tax on all the items. But I'm confused on where exactly that money would go, wouldn't that just go to the state? And if not, I assume it's very illegal to collect ""tax"" money and not give that to the government?

I saw that if upload a resale certificate to Printful, they won't charge you sales tax on your orders. But on the site ([https://www.printful.com/dashboard/billing/resale-certificates](https://www.printful.com/dashboard/billing/resale-certificates)), I see that it asks me for an ID number for every single state.

I filed for a tax permit in Texas (my business' location) and am waiting for my permit for a long 3 weeks before I can upload it as a resale certificate to Printify. Do I have to do that for every single state? That seems extremely difficult to do. If it's just not charging me tax on orders from Texas, that doesn't really do much for me as I sell all over the U.S. 

I would really love any insight, advice, or experience on this. Without figuring this out, my store's margins just don't make sense. I really want to avoid baking the taxes into my price, because then I'm selling a mug for $20+. I'd much rather my checkout say $16.99 + tax vs like a $20 flat fee.

I'm sorry if I'm not explaining this well, I've tried to research this for hours and still feel completely lost.

TL;DR: How do I charge my customer the same taxes Printful charges me? What's the easiest way to do this?"

Is it better to be intentional and selective with the number of variant colors you keep for any product/product template?

I was editing my designs and initially I've only been keeping colors which matched the design ( along with black as a basis of course)

But I was thinking about how if I see too many color options on a product when shopping, it gives me decision paralysis and lowers the chance of me following through with a purchase. I wonder if it's better to be even more selective with color choices. Plus, it looks tacky if you're selling too many variants, it becomes obvious that the item is just mass produced (don't know how to describe the vibe)
