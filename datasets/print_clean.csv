given that i have a product on printful with ""free shipping"" on and it's published to etsy, i expect that:

1. when someone visits my etsy listing from within europe, they see that the product ships from a european location (such as latvia) and the total price includes the price of shipping from europe to europe.

2. when someone visits my etsy listing from the us, they see that the product ships from a us location and the total price includes the price of shipping from the us to the us.

what happens instead is when i visit the listing from europe, etsy says it's shipping from the us, which means the total price includes shipping from the us to europe, which is going to be unnecessarily high, instead of shipping from europe to europe.

when i tried to choose a pod vendor, printful's promise was that it would fulfill every order closest to the customer's location, but this is apparently not the case.

after searching this subreddit for similar issues, i saw a few commenters suggesting to check if the product chosen on printful can actually be fulfilled in different countries. however, i looked multiple times at my product description, and i can't see any mentions of where this product can be fulfilled.

what am i doing wrong? how do i achieve the expected shipping experience? do i need to create two products on printful, one for the us and one for europe, and make them only available in the respective regions on etsy?

any help would be appreciated. thank you",1,etsy printful how to set up shipping from the closest location,i m trying to start selling poster on etsy that are fulfilled by printful i find that the shipping story is confusing a hell given that i have a product on printful with free shipping on and it s published to etsy i expect that 1 when someone visit my etsy listing from within europe they see that the product ship from a european location such a latvia and the total price includes the price of shipping from europe to europe 2 when someone visit my etsy listing from the u they see that the product ship from a u location and the total price includes the price of shipping from the u to the u what happens instead is when i visit the listing from europe etsy say it s shipping from the u which mean the total price includes shipping from the u to europe which is going to be unnecessarily high instead of shipping from europe to europe when i tried to choose a pod vendor printful s promise wa that it would fulfill every order closest to the customer s location but this is apparently not the case after searching this subreddit for similar issue i saw a few commenters suggesting to check if the product chosen on printful can actually be fulfilled in different country however i looked multiple time at my product description and i can t see any mention of where this product can be fulfilled what am i doing wrong how do i achieve the expected shipping experience do i need to create two product on printful one for the u and one for europe and make them only available in the respective region on etsy any help would be appreciated thank you,62,11,66,12,1548,291,1613,285

for a product listing in etsy, i choose us as the origin in the shipping profile:

1. for us purchase: no additional tax and origin is local (us). all good.
2. for eu purchase: etsy adds a customs tax and origin is shown as us.

my question(s):

* if printful have fulfillment centers in 7 countries (including us and eu) then shouldn't the tax that etsy are adding be avoidable in the eu?
* also wouldn't it be more attractive to eu customers if the origin on etsy could show their nearest printful fulfillment center (eu)?
* as i type this it seems like more of an etsy problem than a printful problem.... surely the whole point of have multiple fulfillment centers is to keep shipping fees and taxes down and be closer to the customer etc?
* does printful work like this on other ecommerce platforms?

i spent 2 days and many hours talking to printful support. the result is as expected - it is not their fault, they can't do anything about it. they will send me an email later.

  
ebay and etsy are much more relaxed about shipping times and returns, i can work with customers there. but amazon is a whole different game. **late shipment is an automatic cancellation by amazon. but at the same time printful will not cancel an order once it is sent to fulfillment. even if it has been sitting in that fulfillment for over a week and has been cancelled by amazon days ago, printful refuses to cancel it. they send it to the customer anyway.** once they sent it 3 weeks later, to a customer that cancelled and was refunded.

  
we are not in the holiday rush yet. imagine what it will be in a few weeks! 

  
btw, do not believe when they tell you that they print everything on site. they do not. from my countless hours of talking to their customer support i found that they use ""printing partners"" just like printify. they just do not disclose who those partners are. it is all a smoke show, they don't have their own printing shops. at least printify is transparent about their providers.

  
i am at a loss here, trying to think what is my next move. the best would be, probably, to remove all printful products from amazon and leave only printify products there.

  
this is not an advertisement for printify, this is just a rant and warning about my experience. i hope it helps someone to make the right decision.",1,warning using printful for amazon sale is an unwise decision,i have store on etsy ebay and amazon few hundred product in each store and i use both printful and printify for different product my amazon store with few hundred product from printify and few dozen from printful just got a notice of risk of deactivation reason most product that go from printful are either shipped late past the 5 day handling time or returned for poor printing quality product from printify have printing issue and return too from time to time but it is a rare occasion printful however i got a return for poor quality and 2 late shipment in just the last few day so i got a notice from amazon that another late shipment return or a feedback le than 3 star will result in deactivation of my store i spent 2 day and many hour talking to printful support the result is a expected it is not their fault they can t do anything about it they will send me an email later ebay and etsy are much more relaxed about shipping time and return i can work with customer there but amazon is a whole different game late shipment is an automatic cancellation by amazon but at the same time printful will not cancel an order once it is sent to fulfillment even if it ha been sitting in that fulfillment for over a week and ha been cancelled by amazon day ago printful refuse to cancel it they send it to the customer anyway once they sent it 3 week later to a customer that cancelled and wa refunded we are not in the holiday rush yet imagine what it will be in a few week btw do not believe when they tell you that they print everything on site they do not from my countless hour of talking to their customer support i found that they use printing partner just like printify they just do not disclose who those partner are it is all a smoke show they don t have their own printing shop at least printify is transparent about their provider i am at a loss here trying to think what is my next move the best would be probably to remove all printful product from amazon and leave only printify product there this is not an advertisement for printify this is just a rant and warning about my experience i hope it help someone to make the right decision,60,10,63,11,2151,410,2284,411

\- so naturally i am just trying to limit where the products can be shipped. but after removing countries, a day passes and printful automatically updates the profiles with the countries again. what etsy seems to have done is they no longer offer ""other"" as delivery service. and printful tells us to set ""other"" as their delivery service option. so because of this a) it does not allow you to duplicate a profile made by printful, tweak it and save it (it just doesn't save). b) creating a manual profile has no option for ""other"" delivery service.

i'm having an issue with enabling fulfillment in printful for products i sync in bulk through the api. previously, after syncing products using the **ecommerce platform sync put printful endpoint**, fulfillment would be automatically enabled, with each variant's stock count set to 9999. however, in the past few weeks, this behavior has changed. now, synced products are showing up with **fulfillment disabled** in both printful and the printful app within shopify, and their stock count is set to zero.

here‚Äôs the workflow i‚Äôve been following:

1. i create blank products in shopify using their api.
2. i sync these products using the ecommerce platform sync put printful endpoint
3. normally, the products would then be orderable in shopify, with the correct stock count.

however, since the change, i‚Äôve had to manually click **enable fulfillment** for each product in either printful or the printful app in shopify to fix the issue. this is not scalable for me, as i‚Äôm working with hundreds of products at a time. additionally, attempting to enable fulfillment for many products at once results in errors in the printful app.

i've reached out to support, but so far, no solution has been found, and they've told me it looks good on their end. is there a way to either:

1. change something to go back to the previous behavior where fulfillment was automatically enabled upon syncing?
2. enable fulfillment programmatically or in bulk through the api (as i haven‚Äôt found an endpoint that allows this)?

if i want to go in and change a size on something? 30 second wait. update a quantity? 30 second wait.

is there a more streamlined process than this? am i missing something here? there's no way an order like this should take 2 hours.

guess what? they do not cancel orders that are marked in their system as sent to fulfillment. it will be sent to the customer no matter what, and when? maybe in a few days, or in a few weeks - they don't know.

at that time i pretty much said good bye to the $40 cost of the item. but then they offered to change the shipping address to my home address. oh well, now i will have a nice thing that i designed. not bad outcome after all.

i want each design to be available as every wall art product and bunch of apparel. but going through the full design process for each product is taking forever, compared to something like redbubble.

i don't understand the purpose of the product templates at all. i just tried taking my product template for a ""framed enhanced matte paper poster"" and switching the product to ""framed glossy premium photo paper"" thinking that everything would stay the same. but as soon as i changed the product, everything reset. all of the sizes were selected, and for some reason my design was tiled across the poster and completely off-center.

so what is the point of the templates if they just reset every time you change them in any way? a 'template' should let you insert a new design or switch to a similar product. why not just go to make a new product every time?

plus, my understanding is that the only way to get more than one mockup on your product page is to download the images and then upload them on your site.

other pod sites i've used you can take a design and apply it to a bunch of different products at once, have the same descriptions for each design, etc.

is there a particular browser that printful works better with? i'm using chrome and i'm losing my mind.

tl;dr: is there a way to streamline the product creation process by doing multiple at one time? the same goes for mockups? any instructional videos on how to do it?

when creating an order a (suggested?) ""retail price"" is listed next to the item. this can be edited. i was wondering if the sales tax that printful collects is based on this price, or based on printful's costs+profit, or on some other metric. 

i intend to place an order for a bunch of tees, and to have them available as a fundraising item for a local political group. my cost is based on the printful invoice including tax, plus a $5 markup per tee and the group can sell them for whatever they want above my cost+markup. 

my question concerns how to obtain an accurate printful total during the process of creating the order based on my intended use/sales of the tees. if i change the item ""retail price"" does that change the sales tax figure, hence the printful invoice, and hence my costs? i don't consider this as a retail item, and i don't have any problem with paying a sales tax, i just don't want to unintentionally over-pay the tax! i was thinking of attempting to closely estimate my costs(incl. tax)+ markup *before* placing the order. any suggestions/links would be appreciated!

# background

i run a wordpress woocommerce store with the printful plugin. my store has been active for \~6 months with everything working fine. i'm experienced with wordpress, not as much with woocommerce.

when i push new products to my store, i choose the simplest mockup/ product images to make the push easier. i then create my own product images and upload them to wordpress, replacing the ones from the printful push.

# the issue

when i add my own product photos, it breaks the link between the photos and the color dropdown menu. meaning when i change the selected color, the corresponding product photo is not automatically shown.

i did a test and pushed a random product to my store, *leaving the product photos from printful.* when i did this,  selecting a color automatically switched to the corresponding product photo.

# how do i 'link' my new product photos to the color dropdown?

any guidance appreciated. thanks.

edit: if this is a question for a wordpress community, lmk. it feels appropriate to post here. ",1,change product photo based on color dropdown selection,really surprised i couldn t find the answer to this question by searching reddit and the internet i m sure other people have had this issue someone please point me in the right direction background i run a wordpress woocommerce store with the printful plugin my store ha been active for 6 month with everything working fine i m experienced with wordpress not a much with woocommerce when i push new product to my store i choose the simplest mockup product image to make the push easier i then create my own product image and upload them to wordpress replacing the one from the printful push the issue when i add my own product photo it break the link between the photo and the color dropdown menu meaning when i change the selected color the corresponding product photo is not automatically shown i did a test and pushed a random product to my store leaving the product photo from printful when i did this selecting a color automatically switched to the corresponding product photo how do i link my new product photo to the color dropdown any guidance appreciated thanks edit if this is a question for a wordpress community lmk it feel appropriate to post here,54,8,54,8,1160,207,1223,207

i am, however, facing an issue.

i am adding a ""service fee"" as another order item on my side. this is something else than the markup. my markup is added to each order item already in the request to printful, so that works fine. the service fee is more or less calculated from all of the products at once and is a lump sum that should work like another, singular item added to the order.

what doesn't work is telling printful to account for that ""service fee"" in the final breakdown for the customer.

i simply don't know where to put it in the api request. i tried sending it together with all the other printful items added to the order but pintful, expectedly, is ignoring that item.

i also can't really spread the service fee across all items because then the final breakdown might be off due to rounding errors.

also thinking long term, if i'd already started without integrating would i then be unable to integrate in the future if i suddenly saw a jump in sales and needed things automating, or if i started selling non-personalised things? 

essentially i'm super set in my ways and how i like my listings to look and how i like my shipping profiles etc and when i uploaded an item from my printful templates i was just really unhappy with how it looked

i decided to start a shopify store a few days ago. my question is, once i sync my store to printful, do all of the shipping and fulfillment processes happen automatically? for example, if a consumer purchases a t-shirt from my shopify site, the order will be automatically updated in printful's system and transferred to one of the fulfillment centers (do i need to sign up for these centers or is it just default?). from there, they will help me deliver to the customer's address. is this correct?¬†

also, what should i put in the shipping origin box? printfull (app) is in there, so does that conclude what i meant above is true?¬†

as this is a side hustle and i am new to this i am not vat registered in the uk or anywhere else for that matter.

i am trying to understand a specific example to help me understand vat, pricing, etc. but have found it difficult to find a clear example or confirmation.

let's say i am trying to sell a laptop sleeve.

printful shipping: ¬£4.99  
subtotal: ¬£20.94  
vat 20%: ¬£4.19  
**printful fulfilment total: ¬£25.13**

ok great, so i set my retail price to say printful price +20% so ¬£30.15, seems reasonable to make a few quid on a laptop sleeve. any more and i think it's getting a bit too pricey for a simple laptop sleeve. it's already quite expensive imo.

end customer price  
retail price: ¬£30.15  
customer shipping cost: ¬£4.99  
**total customer price: ¬£35.14**

transaction fees and tax (vat) (currently only using paypal as my payment gateway)  
vat @ 20%: ¬£5.86  
paypal variable fee 2.9%: ¬£1.02  
paypay fixed transaction fee: ¬£0.30  
total paypal fees: ¬£1.32  
**total deductions (printful price + fees + vat): ¬£32.30**

do i need to deduct the vat? i am not vat registered and my current turnover is well below the vat threshold

does paypal withhold this vat amount even if i am not tax-registered?

my profit  
profit:  ¬£2.84  
margin: 8.07%

seems a bit thin, if i need to subtract the vat

(camel cigarettes being one of them). because the printable area on the default shirts wasn't big enough for my liking, so i chose an all-over print.

however using the white aop, i had to cover the rest of the shirt with the base colour (yellow) i wanted. 

see pic for reference, only showing the front, the back is a big print, hence the aop as explained.

  
my questions are two: will the print work? i assume the inside of the shirt will be white? and will they not print it since it has company logos on the design? again here only for personal use but printful obvs don't know that. will they refund me if they can't print it because of copyright infringement?

hi printful community,

i'm in the final stages of setting up my print-on-demand store using printful, and i could really use some advice from those of you who have already gone through this process. what are the key things i should know or do before launching?

here are some specific questions i have:

1. shipping: 
how does the shipping process work with printful? are there any common issues i should be aware of, and how can i best communicate shipping times to my customers?

2. policies:
what policies should i have in place (returns, exchanges, etc.)? are there any templates or examples you recommend?

3. marketing:
what marketing strategies have been most effective for you? any tips on leveraging social media, email marketing, or paid ads to drive traffic and sales?

4. pre-launch must-dos:
what are the absolute must-dos before going live? are there any particular settings, integrations, or checks that are crucial to avoid problems down the line?

5. lessons learned: 
what do you wish you knew before launching your store? any mistakes to avoid or lessons learned that could save me time and headaches?

i'm excited to get started but want to ensure i'm as prepared as possible. any insights, tips, or advice would be greatly appreciated!

thank you in advance for your help!

281,How to double your revenue from email campaigns ,2,1dbm9sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1dbm9sq/how_to_double_your_revenue_from_email_campaigns/,0,2024-06-09 12:25:01,"this post is all about deliverability. the basic math equation is simple. more people will buy from your emails if more people see your emails. so if your open rates are below 20%, you can probably double them by just following the basic tips i give you below.

with that being said, let's get started.

here are 10 things you should avoid doing regularly if you want to have good deliverability:

1. don‚Äôt keep unengaged members on your email list. if your business isn't seasonal and someone hasn't opened your emails in over 6 months you should consider either reducing the volume of emails that are sent to them or completely removing them from your email list. they will bring your open rates down and this will increase your chances of being marketed as spam.

1. break your list down. segmentation does not matter if you have less than 2k emails. but once you get to 10k+ emails you‚Äôll need these 4 basic segments: buyers, non-buyer, engaged customers, and non-engaged customers. you can personalize emails based on what they have bought/viewed. this alone will significantly boost your open rates. think of it like this, what‚Äôs more likely to be opened? free shipping on everything today only or you‚Äôre in lucküé≤ ‚Äì free shipping for the next 6 hours in {{users\_city}} (while recommending items that they have viewed recently in the email)

1. beware of spam filters - did you know that you could get blacklisted? if your domain is unhealthy your emails will almost always go directly to spam. it's almost impossible to revive a domain so be careful how you go about sending from your main domain. also if you burnt a domain in the past from 1 ip address it's likely that if you create a new domain using that same ip address your 2nd domain also will be negatively affected. if you use a shifty email sending provider you will also run into spam filter problems.

1. write a good subject line. the subject line is the single most important aspect of email copywriting. there are typically only 2 types of good subject lines. subject lines to make people curious and subject lines that are direct (typically with a good offer). that‚Äôs literally all there is to it. also, don't lead with a misleading subject line. pissing people off is the easiest way to get spam complaints instead of normal unsubscribes. (spam complaints are way worse for deliverability)

1. don't be inconsistent. algorithms love consistency. this is why the number 1 way to boost engagement on almost any social platform ever created is to post consistently and follow some sort of routine. emails aren't different at all. try to email your most engaged segment every week. this will give you a good average open rate and also it will show the email service provider that people interact with your content regularly.

1. don't try to hide the unsubscribe button. not having an unsubscribe button is illegal but some people just try to use cheat codes like making the unsubscribe text white on a white background. this is the easiest way to increase spam complaints greatly. customers should never feel like you're forcing them to do anything.

1. don't send emails from shady domains. you should have a clear professional-looking sender address. use a business domain, not a regular email account. avoid using any random characters anywhere in the domain and do everything you can to make it very clear where the email is coming from.

1. make sure your grammar is on point. typos of any kind can be a red flag for spam filters. it's impossible to be perfect all the time but at least try to make sure your emails have less typos than this reddit post.

1. never buy email lists and use them for b2c marketing. sending to people without their consent is the worst thing that you could possibly do if you're trying to avoid the spam filter. make sure every single email address that is receiving your emails has opted in.

1. don't use spammy copywriting. most people have literally no idea what this means so i put together a list of things that are generally bad. here is the list of things to avoid: using all caps for subject lines, capitalizing every word in your subject lines all the time, using large fonts, using fonts smaller than size 8 font in main bodies of sales copy, overusing words like free or sale in your subject lines and over using emojis.

i want to end this with a reminder that no one is above spam filters. if you go to your spam folder right now you'll probably see at least one 8 figure company stuck in there multiple times. these people hire ""experts"" and pay them thousands every month and still can't figure it out. so just because your emails are doing okay now, just know that can change fast if you are not careful.",1,how

308,2.5 million in sales while paid ads are turned off,21,1d0uuat,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1d0uuat/25_million_in_sales_while_paid_ads_are_turned_off/,4,2024-05-26 12:57:48,"before i get into the good parts of this post here's a quick disclaimer:  
- this brand did 1.8 million the year before  
- i do not own this brand, i was hired to build a cult-following  
- paid ads were being ran for the first quarter of the year but not converting well

that's relevant information because not every brand can see massive success without paid ads. most of the things i talk about in this post are pretty much useless if you do under 15k/month. now that that's out of the way, let's talk about what i did to nearly double this brand's revenue without dumping more money into ads.

**for those who don't like reading, i'll summarize what i did right here: i built a community around the brand.**

so i'll break down what i did into 5 steps:

1. obtained a shit load of user-generated content

i was able to get 300 videos of people using the brand's products in under 60 days.  
this is easier than it seems. people pay influencers thousands to pose with their products. for a brand with a bit of traction, the value in user-generated content is to get products in front of a larger audience; not necessarily for social proof (like it is for smaller brands). so with that being said, don't spend a lot of money on ugc content unless it's for a promotional post on a page with a large following.

don't fixate on having the prettiest videos. give a wide variety of people the opportunity to submit content.

3 ways you can get user-generated content for free/cheap are:

- use your social media channels to offer a free product in exchange for a video review  
- setup a review email flow, offer existing customers a chance at a full refund for a video testimonial that meets certain criteria  
- directly contact influencers and negotiate/hire someone with a network of influencers to do the negotiation process for you

2. created a blog

i designed a blog page on the website and posted on it 1-2 times per week. i used ai to generate in-season ideas for blog posts, then got my copywriter to do some research and come up with short blog posts that were informative and read well. p.s just using chatgpt to pump out blog content can work but the content will never be as engaging as content written by a real person that understands the marketing angle. we also tried to add user-generated content on the blog pages as much as we could.

this is by far the easiest way to get people back onto your site without them feeling like you're trying to sell them more products. this is the base of the next 3 steps. good blog content makes people in your niche excited to hear from you. this will boost your email open rates, allow you to post in groups that are heavily moderated against promotions, and give you a lot of niche-specific copywriting to work with.

3. created a subreddit (or any type of group)

i created a subreddit for this brand, then i spent hours finding niche-relevant content. then, i queued a whole bunch of posts. i did a mix of reposting content from tiktok, instagram, youtube, etc, and posting the site's blog posts and ugc content. growing the community was tricky but once i got some momentum going it was almost growing itself.

there's major upside to owning a community inside of your niche. you can block your competitors from posting in your sub and post as much promotional content as you want. you can also mix content, so people have no idea if you're promoting a store, sharing a funny photo, or giving a useful recommendation. you'd honestly be shocked by the amount of traffic our weekly pinned post brought to the site.

4. discord community

i used social media, reddit, and emails to grow the community to 11 thousand members in under a year. customers were giving design ideas, connecting with store employees, and volunteering to send content with products for free.

this is like a reddit community but more personal. the main difference between the discord and the reddit is that the discord is branded and the reddit is just niche specific. this is a good place to run competitions and polls, and also just interact with customers on a personal level. you can get a tone of ugc from a discord community if you use it right.

5. email and sms marketing

i saved the best for last. normally my posts are mainly focused on emails but i thought i'd switch it up today to truly convey what goes on behind the scenes of well-coordinated email/sms marketing.  
think of emails as an ongoing conversation between you and your customer. you play the role of a friend recommending things to a peer. you already know things about them, like their interests, location, and buying habits. now use segmentation and predictive analytics to make sure relevant content gets sent to interested people. i'll leave it at that.

but before i leave i'll share some more info about this brand that may be relevant. it's a breed-specific animal brand, this brand has been around for about 4 years and has consistently grown 30-40% each year with last year being an outlier (almost doubled sales), the people in this niche are extremely passionate about their pets so this may have made it easier for me to grow a community this quickly, and the 2.5 million that i am attributing to my systems are just the sales that came from email and sms marketing.  
thanks so much for taking the time to read my post, id be happy to provide more clarity on any of the subjects that i mentioned in this post.",1,2 5 million in sale while paid ad are turned off,before i get into the good part of this post here s a quick disclaimer this brand did 1 8 million the year before i do not own this brand i wa hired to build a cult following paid ad were being ran for the first quarter of the year but not converting well that s relevant information because not every brand can see massive success without paid ad most of the thing i talk about in this post are pretty much useless if you do under 15k month now that that s out of the way let s talk about what i did to nearly double this brand s revenue without dumping more money into ad for those who don t like reading i ll summarize what i did right here i built a community around the brand so i ll break down what i did into 5 step 1 obtained a shit load of user generated content i wa able to get 300 video of people using the brand s product in under 60 day this is easier than it seems people pay influencers thousand to pose with their product for a brand with a bit of traction the value in user generated content is to get product in front of a larger audience not necessarily for social proof like it is for smaller brand so with that being said don t spend a lot of money on ugc content unless it s for a promotional post on a page with a large following don t fixate on having the prettiest video give a wide variety of people the opportunity to submit content 3 way you can get user generated content for free cheap are use your social medium channel to offer a free product in exchange for a video review setup a review email flow offer existing customer a chance at a full refund for a video testimonial that meet certain criterion directly contact influencers and negotiate hire someone with a network of influencers to do the negotiation process for you 2 created a blog i designed a blog page on the website and posted on it 1 2 time per week i used ai to generate in season idea for blog post then got my copywriter to do some research and come up with short blog post that were informative and read well p s just using chatgpt to pump out blog content can work but the content will never be a engaging a content written by a real person that understands the marketing angle we also tried to add user generated content on the blog page a much a we could this is by far the easiest way to get people back onto your site without them feeling like you re trying to sell them more product this is the base of the next 3 step good blog content make people in your niche excited to hear from you this will boost your email open rate allow you to post in group that are heavily moderated against promotion and give you a lot of niche specific copywriting to work with 3 created a subreddit or any type of group i created a subreddit for this brand then i spent hour finding niche relevant content then i queued a whole bunch of post i did a mix of reposting content from tiktok instagram youtube etc and posting the site s blog post and ugc content growing the community wa tricky but once i got some momentum going it wa almost growing itself there s major upside to owning a community inside of your niche you can block your competitor from posting in your sub and post a much promotional content a you want you can also mix content so people have no idea if you re promoting a store sharing a funny photo or giving a useful recommendation you d honestly be shocked by the amount of traffic our weekly pinned post brought to the site 4 discord community i used social medium reddit and email to grow the community to 11 thousand member in under a year customer were giving

my idea for a solution: if i just use a solid fill as a kind of ‚Äúbacking‚Äù behind the art using a light beige or dark grey, depending on the image, would this solve the issue of disconnected and ‚Äútransparent‚Äù elements? (image 2, beige added in solid behind any area with any stippling)

i realize it will impact the overall image and colours etc but if i can make that work, will it print essentially as i see it? 

and if this will theoretically work, do i need to fill the whole image (image 3 with whole outline filled) or just the space behind/around where the artwork is more transparent?

thanks for helping a newbie out!

i‚Äôm planning to create a series of custom shirts featuring some iconic sayings. i‚Äôll be using printful for this project and i want to make sure i‚Äôm doing everything correctly to achieve the best results.

here‚Äôs a bit about what i‚Äôm aiming to do:
- i have a list of 60 iconic sayings along with the date and location where they were said.
- i want to design these sayings to be printed on shirts and possibly other items like hoodies, mugs, etc.

i have a few questions and would love your advice:

1. **design tips**: what are some best practices for designing text-based graphics for shirts? are there any specific fonts or design elements that work best for this type of content?
   
2. **printful setup**: what‚Äôs the best way to set up my designs in printful? should i use their built-in design tool, or is it better to create the designs in a separate program like adobe illustrator or photoshop and then upload them?
   
3. **file formats**: what file formats and sizes should i use to ensure high-quality prints?
   
4. **mockups**: how can i create realistic mockups to see how the shirts will look before placing an order? any tips on using printful‚Äôs mockup generator effectively?
   
5. **marketing and sales**: any advice on marketing and selling these shirts once they‚Äôre ready? are there particular platforms or strategies that work well for custom apparel?

however, on selling it for ¬£29.50+shipping (so ¬£32.79), i only made ¬£2.14 in profit, and this is before stripe took ¬£0.69 in payment fees. so i seem to only be making ¬£1.45 on each sale. which seems really low since the customer spent ¬£32.79 on the t-shirt, including vat and shipping fees.

typically i would have expected at least 5%-20% margins, based on other industries i've worked in. especially since printful themselves say to expect 30% to 50% in their article at [https://www.printful.com/uk/blog/how-much-money-can-custom-t-shirts-make](https://www.printful.com/uk/blog/how-much-money-can-custom-t-shirts-make)

i know the most obvious answer is to put the price up, but the quality of the t-shirts do not justify the price being higher, even when the graphics are good (which i pay around ¬£100 each time to be done professionally). the t-shirts are very simply constructed compared to others of a similar price range.

if they had a couple tweaks, like a support fabric on the back of the neck, and maybe a bit better fabric, it would be fine. but it really is a simple construction, even compared to t-shirts of the same and less cost from other small brands. (i'm still figuring that one out). like how does ben parkes (a famous runner) sell running t-shirts cheaper with a better quality, or happy stride/red bear?

any advice? or should i just use printful as a testing ground for designs and start getting a factory involved to make them in bulk?

thanks in advance.

it was my assumption that when using printful to publish to square, printful would handle the shipping and that the cost of shipping would be added upon checkout based on the address. should be automatic. is this a glitch on square's end, printful's end, or user error (maybe i need to do something to fix it)?

edit: 

have managed to fix this issue. it turns out it is not automatically done from printful, but i needed to add the shipping profiles for each item and location manually! printful provides the shipping rates on their site but these are not pushed from printful to square when adding the item from printful. i also learned that all of the items from printful were showing up as out of stock, although they are printondemand and therefore have unlimited stock. the solution to this was to go into the item variations and select ""tracking"" and for the reason, select ""received stock."" for the amount of stock received, i simply entered 999999999 so this item should no longer run out of stock.

i still haven't figured out how to lower the shipping rate for additional items. for example, selling a backpack in canada, the shipping rate is as follows:

|canada|c$14.55|+c$7.95|
|:-|:-|:-|


i could only figure out how to set one shipping rate. i therefore selected $14.55, but customers should be getting a discounted rate of $7.95 if ordering multiples. if anyone knows how to fix this, i'd be so grateful!",1,square integration shipping issue,hello i ve just started using printful and have tried to connect it to my square account so i can sell product on my website http littlestdinosaur square site merch i ve managed to add some product to the site and thought i had everything set up properly but then i had a customer contact me saying that her address is not supported i tried other address but couldn t even get my own address to work so now i m thinking i ve done something wrong along the way or skipped a step can t find anything on printful or square website to clarify it wa my assumption that when using printful to publish to square printful would handle the shipping and that the cost of shipping would be added upon checkout based on the address should be automatic is this a glitch on square s end printful s end or user error maybe i need to do something to fix it edit have managed to fix this issue it turn out it is not automatically done from printful but i needed to add the shipping profile for each item and location manually printful provides the shipping rate on their site but these are not pushed from printful to square when adding the item from printful i also learned that all of the item from printful were showing up a out of stock although they are printondemand and therefore have unlimited stock the solution to this wa to go into the item variation and select tracking and for the reason select received stock for the amount of stock received i simply entered 999999999 so this item should no longer run out of stock i still haven t figured out how to lower the shipping rate for additional item for example selling a backpack in canada the shipping rate is a follows canada c 14 55 c 7 95 i could only figure out how to set one shipping rate i therefore selected 14 55 but customer should be getting a discounted rate of 7 95 if ordering multiple if anyone know how to fix this i d be so grateful,33,4,33,4,1895,363,1981,341

now, most videos on youtube seem to suggest going with printify, but looking deeper into it, i think printful is the better choice for me.

yes, it may work out more expensive at first glance, however, i really want my product to have a high quality.  and not just the physical product itself, but also the overall shopping experience for the customer.

so, although it is more expensive, i think the high quality product and service will bring back repeat customers, and create more word of mouth and positive reviews, leading to more future sales and therefore more profit in the long run.

at least that's my current line of thinking.

but i definitely want to hear what others have to say.

i am thinking of having a printed logo on the back of the shirts (inside or outside, not yet decided).  or maybe an embroidered logo.  i also want some decent packaging with a friendly note card of some kind, to thank them for the purchase and hopefully it will act as a reminder or just some good will to bring them back to the store again.

again, this is essentially more expense for me on my end, but i am hoping it leads to a better quality service and therefore more profit in the long run.

someone also mentioned sending a heartwarming email to any customers thanking them for the purchase too.

does anyone have any other ideas or recommendations like this?

this is what i do and if there's any mistake, please tell me!!!!!!

1. create my products as usual, sync.
2. the synchronization fails like 95% of the time. some fails don't put the product on the amazon inventory, the regular fails are like missing fields and things like that.
3. i go to amazon and check what can i do, edit, etc.
4. wait until the calculated commissions from amazon show up, raise prices.
5. and no matter what i get sync errors on printful and incomplete info on amazon.

a two pronged problem, all related to shipping globally.

\#1 i'm doing a little project with my son to give him some work experience in graphic design and ecommerce through setting up pod in an etsy shop, and maybe he'll make a little bit of pocket money for the summer. we've uploaded some templates into our printful account, but ran into a small snag.   
the first product we tried to create using one of our own uploaded templates stated that the t-shirt design was not available in our sales region (uk) (didn't mention that in the template creation section), but i thought pod was global in delivery and that printful would use the nearest fulfilment centre to the customer (the etsy customer) , so i'm confused why it doesn't allow us to upload the design for sales in regions where it is available.  


2# i read on the etsy boards that in order to sell in different regions, you need to set up each listing according the delivery region:

  
""...  you have to set up a listing that ""ships from"" the usa, then put in the shipping profile only the countries that one ships to,

set up the same item with a listing of ""ships from uk"" with only the countries that ships to

and another ""ships from"" spain, and only the countries that ships to

and the other ""ships from"" canada, and only the countries that one ships to""  


i'm very confused as to how that works in practice with a connected printful account, especially in light of my first problem where printful says our design isn't available in our sales region with no other regions as an option.   


can anybody decode this for me? üòÅ i've looked extensively through the printful help articles but can't find anything that explains this.

when the buyers send pictures, it looks like the mugs have just been put haphazardly into cardboard boxes with absolutely no padding at all. before, when i‚Äôve ordered samples, they were shipped in custom formed boxes that padded the mugs beautifully. apparently that‚Äôs no longer a thing?

508,Pricing Items on Printful is So Difficult,2,1aqnxh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1aqnxh7/pricing_items_on_printful_is_so_difficult/,8,2024-02-14 21:18:27,"the price editing in printful is so much more difficult than it has to be.

instead of just being able to bulk edit everything in the shop to take in a certain percentage of profit, the only options are to either add/subtract a percentage to the number currently set, or to set the price directly. 

so, if i have some things set on 80% and others on 100%, and i want 150%, i would have to manually add 70 to the items currently set at 80%, and 50 to the ones set at 100%. i can't just universally set everything to take 150%.

not only that, but if you set the percentage of profit you want to recieve, the numbers seem to randomly change by up to 10 percent when you go back in to check it. you set it to 150, then come back and it's 145.

third thing is, when you bulk edit on printful, it only changes the 10 on viewbale items on the page. you have to go through each page and edit in groups of 10. fine if you have 20 items, not so much if you have 7000.

maybe i'm just being dumb and missing something, but no other platform i use makes setting prices this difficult. eg, redbubble - how much profit would would like to recieve per item? 150%. done. all items set to recieive 150% profit from their base value. 

on printful, instead of changing the percentage from it's base value,  eg, 100 to 150, all you can do is change it from the percentage that it's currently set to. you can't even just add 50 to 100 to make it 150, because it doesn't add 50% of the base value. it adds 50% of the of the base value + the original 100% added, which comes to a different number than 150% of base value. it's just a stupid way to edit prices. 

if you think i'm wrong about this, put up a new item and select decrease by 100% and keep clicking set. printful, not only allows you to sell for no profit, but the system actually allows you make negative percentages. you can actually set you profit margin to -20,000%. why would that be an option? some shoddy developer has been working overtime. i don't want to have to calculate how to get to 250% from where it is. i just want to be able to type it and set it. all it takes is a one field entry. there's no need for stacking percentages on top of percentages.",1,pricing item on printful is so difficult,the price editing in printful is so much more difficult than it ha to be instead of just being able to bulk edit everything in the shop to take in a certain percentage of profit the only option are to either add subtract a percentage to the number currently set or to set the price directly so if i have some thing set on 80 and others on 100 and i want 150 i would have to manually add 70 to the item currently set at 80 and 50 to the one set at 100 i can t just universally set everything to take 150 not only that but if you set the percentage of profit you want to recieve the number seem to randomly change by up to 10 percent when you go back in to check it you set it to 150 then come back and it s 145 third thing is when you bulk edit on printful it only change the 10 on viewbale item on the page you have to go through each page and edit in group of 10 fine if you have 20 item not so much if you have 7000 maybe i m just being dumb and missing something but no other platform i use make setting price this difficult eg redbubble how much profit would would like to recieve per item 150 done all item set to recieive 150 profit from their base value on printful instead of changing the percentage from it s base value eg 100 to 150 all you can do is change it from the percentage that it s currently set to you can t even just add 50 to 100 to make it 150 because it doesn t add 50 of the base value it add 50 of the of the base value the original 100 added which come to a different number than 150 of base value it s just a stupid way to edit price if you think i m wrong about this put up a new item and select decrease by 100 and keep clicking set printful not only allows you to sell for no profit but the system actually allows you make negative percentage you can actually set you profit margin to 20 000 why would that be an option some shoddy developer ha been working overtime i don t want to have to calculate how to get to 250 from where it is i just want to be able to type it and set it all it take is a one field entry there s no need for stacking percentage on top of percentage,40,7,41,7,2105,442,2207,431

i escalated my case until i was able to speak with a manager at printify. the manager asked for my tiktok shop code and forwarded it to tiktok's team, promising that i would receive an update via email. however, after waiting for a couple of days without any response, i decided to contact printify again.

printify told me that tiktok had been informed about the problem and that it had been resolved. following their guidance, i attempted to appeal my ban on tiktok. when i spoke to tiktok's customer service, they explained that the ban was due to a discrepancy between my personal address and the warehouse address. they told me to appeal the ban and provide my personal documents, which i did. but as i knew it would, my appeal was denied.

now, i have a 15-day window to submit a second appeal, but i'm fairly certain it will also be denied. i have tried explaining to 20 different tiktok representatives that printify is a tiktok partner, and i won't be able to provide the warehouse address documents they are requesting. however, i continue to be advised to submit an appeal.

my question pertains to sizing - obviously there are size guides available, but i'm not sure how much to trust them.  i have my location and currency set as the uk, but my store is intended to ship all products worldwide (mainly so i can get the full extent of products and let the customer choose if they're willing to wait). i'm trying to order some samples so i can wear them myself if the quality is good enough.  


the shoes are pretty simple; i'm a size 8 in uk womens; they're womens shoes and i have no reason to believe the sizing in the guide would be for another country. so can i trust that to be accurate?  


the issue comes with my hoodie. normally in most clothes i'm a medium or large, 14/16, depending on the brand. but according to the size guide, my measurements would put me at a 2xs, which i don't trust at all. could it just be because i'm a women ordering unisex clothes and therefore i need to be lower down the spectrum? what would truly tiny women order if that sizing was accurate? i'm okay with some bagginess in my hoodies, so i'd rather order too big than too small, but i'm trying to replace a hoodie that is falling off me.

my only other issue has been with adding certain products to amazon. shoes will not list to the u.s. market but most other products so far will list fine after applying for a gtin exemption for those specific catagories.

i spoke with printful support and they acknowledged that the shoes not listing is an error on their end. 

recently i cam across a store on amazon that had obvious printful listings for shoes and he explained that he manually created those listings. ill admit a lot of this is very new to me. i am wondering if i create a manual listing for shoes will it then be able to sync with my printful dashboard after it is created? also why and how do i get my mexico and canada stores to show up for printful.

i am pretty much pleading for help here.. i have 600 products i can potentially list to amazon and 200 listed so far.  if any staff at printful are reading this please can i speak with someone more directly. that can help me troubleshoot a few of these problems more closely.

i have done some research on white underbases, and have seen that it used to make the colours pop on black garments. i have also seen some printful designs on black t shirts and they have turned out fine.

i was wondering if it will actually turn out dull like the design says, or if it will turn out fine, and it is just what the t shirt will look like without the white underbase.

1. printful will charge **us** sales tax on every customer order based on the amount of the printful cost to us of the order. we can register in michigan and submit a resale permit to printful, and they will no longer charge **us** sales tax but only for sales to customers **in michigan**. printful will still charge **us** sales tax on our cost of orders to all other states (where they have nexus). through a complicated and painful process it might be possible to also register for a resale certificate in other states.
2. we need to set up shopify to charge sales tax for sales to shipping addresses in michigan since we have a physical location here (our kitchen table where we set our laptops). shopify will collect the sales tax, remit it to us, and provide us with a report of tax collected (quarterly? annually?) we will be responsible for remitting the collected sales tax to the state of michigan along with the correct tax form, even if the total tax is minimal.

how exactly does printful expect their clients to make any money? perhaps raise the price to 90$ a hoodie and scare off potential customers?

i'm setting up a shop based in switzerland on etsy and integrating with printful for fulfillment. i have some complex vat-related questions for orders fulfilled and shipped within the eu and the uk respectively. i would appreciate any insights you can provide.

**here's the scenario:**

* my store is in switzerland (non-eu), and i‚Äôll be using printful, which has eu and uk fulfillment centers.
* for orders under ‚Ç¨150 in the eu and under ¬£135 in the uk, i assume etsy would handle vat collection appropriately based on their policies and my store location.
* however, for orders above these thresholds, there seems to be a potential vat loophole. etsy would not collect vat at checkout, assuming customs duties will be applied, but since the orders are actually fulfilled within the eu/uk, they won‚Äôt go through customs.

**my questions for the community:**

1. how does etsy/printful handle vat for orders above ‚Ç¨150 in the eu and above ¬£135 in the uk that are fulfilled within the respective regions but sold from a non-eu/uk-based store like mine?
2. has anyone else encountered this situation in either the eu or the uk? if so, how did you manage vat collection to ensure compliance?

printful's response indicated that etsy wouldn‚Äôt know the fulfillment location at the time of the order, suggesting this vat issue might indeed arise. i‚Äôm looking to understand how best to navigate this and ensure accurate vat application for my eu and uk customers.

nutshell,

pros: quality of products and prints for numerous items are usually very good! ease of use, website integration and of course not having to do fulfillment/shipping makes it super nice.

cons: the biggest one for me is product cost and shipping costs sometimes being outrageous.

pros in depth: nearly every product i‚Äôve ever sold i order a sample to ensure my customers will receive a quality product, each and every time i‚Äôve done this the product has been top notch quality. for most popular website hosts it is super easy to integrate printful in the back end so orders automatically get sent over to printful from your website which makes things super hands free. as an artist who is in different states/cities numerous days of the week i‚Äôm simply too busy to do stock, fulfill and ship orders so the ease of using printful makes things a breeze for me.

cons in depth:
the cost in some styles/design placements can sometimes be double or even triple in comparison to working with manufacturers directly (obviously this is where printful is making a large chunk middle-manning) my next biggest gripe is the shipping cost, as someone who‚Äôs been selling merch, fulfilling orders and shipping items myself some of the shipping on items is once again double or even triple the rate of shipping it yourself with a label printer. for instance: my now fianc√© ordered a backpack from my website, i used the suggested price margin and i ended up losing $20 due to the hidden costs of digitization (which is almost always a scam, it‚Äôs just turning your design into an svg file‚Ä¶ you can do this online for free btw), then the outrageous shipping cost they tacked on. i ended up being able to see how they shipped it, they used an overly sized box (could‚Äôve comfortably fit 5-6 of the backpacks in this one box for one backpack) which could‚Äôve easily fit in a polybag and shipped out for $4-$6 since when i weighed it, it was under 16oz to utilize ground (2-3 days). they charged $18 for shipping this. personally felt robbed and also feel printful needs to be more upfront with shipping cost and would suggest them putting that into the cost section when you are setting your retail price (instead of giving you unrealistic profit margins) in a nutshell, that first week of me releasing numerous merch items i netted roughly -$150 before i was able to catch what was going on. i would highly suggest triple checking prices of things before fully launching items with the impression of having good margins.

from what i gathered by searching online, for images that are 3088 x 2048, it would be best not to print a poster that is 16""x20"" or bigger. i thought of asking here if anyone would know if this is right, or if there is another poster size that i shouldn't exceed.

for example, i ordered from hamilton, ontario which is 70km away from their toronto fulfillment center, instead, they shipped the product from north carolina which is 1220km away. so their algorithm hasn't been optimized for canadian customers. i paid over 40% more for my order once duty fees were applied, and felt sick about the cost on the planet in terms of emissions of fossil fuels being burned to ship me a box of t-shirts at such a great distance. part of the reason i use print-on-demand is to have less of a carbon footprint since there is less textile waste. but this experience leads me to believe they don't share the same values. profits first.

question 1: how is the shipping actually working? does it ship from latvia from a certain carrier (dhl? ups? who?) to finland and in here is it the local companies?
question 2: where do they ship it? if my customers put their homeaddress, does it ship always there, or in some local post office / post box etc?
question 3: i can integrate via different apps a way to let the customer choose the closest postal office / place for picking up the package based on the address location they put in there. if they lets say put an address in central of tampere, and it would offer a post locker as the pickup location, does printiful send in to the mentioned locker, or the persons home address, or somewhere else?

the issue is that i can't seem to get the color information for all the variants directly from this endpoint. i can get variant ids and use them to fetch the color, but it feels incredibly inefficient to make a separate request for each color. that's 6 different requests just for color info!

1. am i using the wrong endpoint for this?

2) when making a template by going to the editor via product catalog, it lets me save the template but the product template listing takes forever to update (which means i cannot download mockups at all) unless i go somewhere else and then return to the listing. it then won't let me add the item to the store. i get to the first view where you'd proceed to mockups but no further. sometimes making a duplicate of the template works and you can add the duplicate, sometimes not.

845,Printful has been so difficult to use that I am giving up,1,16denp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/16denp2/printful_has_been_so_difficult_to_use_that_i_am/,9,2023-09-08 23:09:05,"i started working with printful several months ago and i would have dozens of products listed on etsy right now if not for the confusing and unintuitive nature of the website.

the website suffers from two common maladies:

1) it is apparently created by engineers who are so familiar with the site that they've completely forgotten what it looks like to new users trying to learn it.

2) they are so hungry for more of my business that they're constantly inserting ads into every step of the design process, which is distracting and annoying.

example: 

i'm trying to design a bumper sticker.  literally at every step there is a lack of clarity and a bunch of distractions.  

i search for ""bumper sticker"" (one of the most common kinds of sticker on the planet) and there are no search results.  okay... so i pick the option that looks the most like a bumper sticker and start designing.   it says it's a ""kiss cut"" sticker?  i'm new.  i don't know what that means.  is it explained anywhere?  no, of course not. but it looks like a rectangle so i roll with it and start designing.  

writing text on the sticker is easy enough, but how do i change the background color?  this is something that should be clear and obvious but totally isn't.  as i'm looking all over the page, clicking various unnamed buttons trying to find it, my frustration grows.  instead of finding help i see  a bunch of ads telling me to put my bumper sticker design on coffee cups and tee shirts, etc.  

and this happens continually.  every time i've made some progress, instead of seeing the next step i am bombarded by marketing for other projects on printful. how about one thing at a time?  instead of trying to sell me ten other products before i've finished my first one, how about helping me finish the first one?  

so i eventually give up on the background color and transition to the next step and that's when i see that the text is cut out instead of being on a rectangular sticker.  is that what ""kiss cut"" means? why wasn't that shown before?  how do i make a motherflipping bumper sticker?  is it even possible?  i've spent 45 frustrating minutes and i still don't know the answer to this most basic question.

i did go to the help section of the site where there are video tutorials but before i can watch the first video i am required to take a quiz?  are you freaking kidding me?  i come here for help, feeling confused and exasperated with the opaqueness of the site and the *first thing* i have to do is take a *test*?  i have to answer questions that i obviously don't know the answers to because i don't have permission to watch the tutorial before i take the test?  

now extrapolate.  

this is the ""intelligence"" behind the entire website.

there is something seriously wrong with a website that forces me to leave the site constantly to search google and youtube for answers, just to understand the most basic functions of the site.  the fact that there are so many lengthy tutorials on youtube is a sign of the failure of the site to fulfill it's fundamental purpose: to make it easy for people to design and list lots of products so we can all make money.

when i noticed something looked off on the mockup i opened a chat with them just to make sure i wasn't seeing things or maybe it was the model being slightly turned. sure enough the file was off center. a perfectly round circle design. they printed it. 21 tshirts printed off center. they are not sellable.

if anyone has an experience, how accurate are printful posters to printful mockups? (enhanced matte paper poster(in), specifically). i attached the photos below for more clarity.

1st photo is how the printful employee told me to position the image, but 2nd photo is how the mockup comes out. i want the bottom part of the photo (the vertical neon lines) to reach the very edge of the poster and not get abruptly cropped, but idk what employees use as a guide for cropping the poster after printing it.

i got in touch with the support staff and they told me that it was due to the dpi being too high, and that it should be in the recommended 150-300 dpi range. in any case, they were extremely nice and offered to give me a full refund for this.

for that, i am truly thankful! i would not have expected i) the high dpi to cause the cracking/peeling/blurring of the print on the products and ii) for this to be the outcome/resolution for my case.

nevertheless, i am making this post for anyone who is starting their business and doesn't end up making the same mistake as i did. maybe having too much dpi is also not a good thing.

finally - i launched my store today and guess what - i got my first sale! i'm so happy! i know it's not a big deal but i worked on this constantly for a long time and seeing this sale really made me happy.

1. **fix the payment security algorithm.**
2. **make sure the email doesn't get flagged as promotion/spam by changing the text or providing a link to a webpage explaining the steps to verify the payment.**
3. **automate a confirmation email that the customer's email was received successfully, because i was stressing that my email might not actually have ended in the printful inbox. this helps bring a feeling of security and stops people from spamming the email.**

ordered samples for my new business that i will be launching soon to make sure the product quality and print are fine and i could validate it myself.

unfortunately, the quality i received is just... bad! the design is cracked/peeling off, looks chunky and moreover, also looks kinda blurry.

i am working with graphic designers so every design i have used has been properly vetted and has a minimum dpi of around 600 and some go up to 1000-1200.

do you have any advice for me? i would really not prefer to launch my store if the quality is sub-standard.

p.s. i used to work for a fashion brand before, and they used printful as well - not that many issues with print quality and the design. what product variant should i use to print? specifically, for t-shirts, sweaters and hoodies? i'm honestly a bit bummed. i get that printful provides a good cost and i understand their policies well - i'm just trying to see how i can create a balance between that and providing my prospective clients decent quality merch that doesn't feel like it was drop-shipped from far away for a few bucks.

honestly, if it was me, i would wear it as they are just samples. but if i paid good money for it, then i would not be satisfied with this type of quality. i really hope that it is just a one-off case and i got unlucky. or maybe because of the specific location it was created/dispatched from.

i've attached a couple of images here!

any advice/tips are appreciated. thank you for your time to do this, it really helps!

875,How to communicate with your customers without spamming basic promotions,1,162hz5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/162hz5g/how_to_communicate_with_your_customers_without/,0,2023-08-27 12:45:53,"hello!

 its easy to just do the bare minimum when it comes with b2c direct marketing. but please, don't be that brand owner that only contacts your customers when there's a sale. all this does is guarantee a slow decline in your open rates and interest in your brand. keep your emails interesting and fresh. from my experience there's only 2 reasons why anyone opens a branded email; they're either   
curious about what's inside or the think that the content of the email will benefit them somehow. i put this post together too give you some idea's for campaigns that you can send that aren't just basic sales.

  
here are 10 newsletter ideas:  
  
**the thank-you email** \- plain text, keep it simple. i made an entire post about why this is the most powerful email you can possibly send earlier. if the didn't see that post, here's the short version. i sent out hundreds of emails for brands in completely different niches and there was one email that outperformed everything. it was a plain text email from the ""ceo"" that had a humble tone and just thanked customers for supporting the business.  
  
**the product highlight email** \- no discount needed. pick an interesting product with good social proof and good reviews, then talk to the customer about what makes the product unique. compliment your claims with social proof.  
  
**the review request** \- this could be implemented into a flow or directly sent to repeat customers as a newsletter. not many people will send you detailed reviews unless you ask, incentivize, and tell them what you're looking for.  
  
**the q&a email** \- could be a survey, could just be a question snuck into other campaigns. the goal is to ask important questions. when you receive the answer you boost your domain health and gain some data. for example, on a streetwear brand: ask clients about what they want to see next. on a candle brand: get them to vote for the next scent. on a fitness brand: ask about their fitness goals etc.  
  
**niche educational email** \- give out educational niche-relevant information. this is great for stores that have a blog or cross-post a lot on social media. teach them about something they are interested in learning.  
  
**the holiday email** \- aside from ecom holidays like bfcm, you should also reach out to them on regular holidays. regardless of if you want to run a holiday promotion or not, at least wish your customers a happy holiday.  
  
**the video campaign** \- make a video of yourself, post it, and link it into an email. screenshot the video and use it as an image in the email. this is a very personal way to interact with your customers, and it gets them to engage with you on another platform like youtube or instagram. when you make this video campaign remember to keep them quick, interesting, and informative. once they leave the original email, the competition gets fierce; you're now competing for attention against fast-paced instagram reels and tiktoks.  
  
**the funny email** \- don't even try to be professional. a lot of the time you can throw people off and get a reaction by simply being unprofessional and saying things they wouldn't expect you to say. if you're actually a funny person, you can see insane results with these emails in plain text. if you're not the best at coming up with this kind of stuff, just cross-post memes and funny niche-relevant posts from social media.  
  
**giveaway/interactive incentive discount** \- give a discount or a reward in a fun way. code a wheel of fortune with a ""random"" discount onto your site or set up a giveaway of something you know your customers would be excited about. this is better than just giving a standard discount because it incorporates an element of chance. it gets customers to go to your site without having any intention of buying that day. this traffic still holds value because now you get 2 chances to convert them, once via email and once when they actually get on your giveaway landing page.  
  
**storytelling email** \- this type of email is literally gold. this is one of the most effective emails because you can connect with your customer's emotions. whether it's your own personal story or a niche-relevant story you've found online, you can use the story to connect with your customers. you can even break down stories into multiple emails; you can have a huge promotion and sneak in a much-anticipated part 3 to last week's story. always remember, emotion sells.

once again, thanks for reading my post. i hope you got something out of it. if you have other ideas for email/sms campaigns, feel free to share below.

877,Question for EU-based businesses selling to the UK,2,1613hnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/printful/comments/1613hnw/question_for_eubased_businesses_selling_to_the_uk/,1,2023-08-25 23:08:56,"so we're a eu-based company, looking to open a shop using printful. we've been investigating taxation issues to make sure we got a handle on things before we open, and we're confused about the taxation printful makes for orders shipped to and/or fulfilled in the uk. 

on this [nifty table](https://www.printful.com/uk/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-selling-internationally#h-taxes) on their blog, printful says the tax base for orders to the uk is the printful price (not the retail price).  from this, i assumed they were invoicing our company and charging us vat for the products... but in that case, it wouldn't make sense that they would charge us 20%, since that's not the vat rate in our country. 

another explanation (and one that seems more likely from [printful's help page](https://help.printful.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408221934738-how-does-printful-charge-vat-in-the-uk-)), is that they charge vat to the final client (over the retail price) and remit it for us to the hmrc. if that is the case, i guess it works a bit like norway, and we wouldn't need to sign up for a uk vat id, as the vat is already taken care of.

or... maybe something else entirely is happening and i don't get it. üòÖ

if you have a business in the eu that ships to the uk, please share your experiences, so that i can try to understand what happens when an order is sent there.

i've been reading through posts in this sub and a lot of research in general on sales tax. my understanding is that if i have nexus in a particular state (doing business from, having the address registered as, more sales, etc) i should register and apply for a reseller/sales tax permit so that printful would not charge me sales tax.

i'm a sole proprietor right now, using square as the storefront and connecting printful to square to fulfill order. my problem is that i currently live in minnesota, but have california listed as the address for the store (but there is no physical store - that's just my home address). i am however moving to colorado at the end of october - so very soon. the store/business is not live yet - i wanted to resolve this issue before starting so i don't have to pay sales tax to printful. square also does a weird auto tax calculator but i guess this is not the sub to ask about that part.

i'm assuming if i apply for sales tax permits from california and minnesota, i would also have to file taxes in both states, which i currently don't do for california because i don't have income from there. i am thinking if it would be easier to just wait until i move to colorado, then apply for the sales tax permit from colorado and send it to printful to be exempt. is my thinking correct? i also don't expect a huge sales number - most of them would be from minnesota and california.

i know this subject has been broached here a few times but i have some additional questions about printing white on black tees.

i'm going to be launching a store in the next week or so and the majority of my shirts have white designs on black tees. i read that there is an issue with the white cracking due to dtg printers only using one layer for white. user u/instantstar56 mentioned a useful hack of printing white areas in a very light grey to force printful to do a second layer. makes sense. they recommended hex code dcd6e9.

i've changed the white in my design to  dcd6e9, but it looks noticeably purple on my monitor and i'm concerned about what the print will look like. does anyone have experience using this method (photos would be helpful). the design in question also has red text close to the white that makes the purple stand out. could i just use a light grey that doesn't have a hint of color such as e9e9e9, or maybe a light grey with a hint of red in this instance?

another tip i read is that you can duplicate your print file layer within the printful design studio and printful will double print the layers. does anyone know if this works or does printful flatten the layers into one image prior to printing? i've read conflicting info.

thanks for any help, and hopefully this will help other designers as well.

edit: here is a sample that shows the white replaced by dcd6e9 next to a red text

am i doing something wrong, is there another setting or something that i need to do, that i'm missing?

hope you're well,

a bit confused so was hoping someone could help me out.

so a bit of background. i have a shop on etsy with printful as my pod partner, and i'm selling to the usa only, from the uk.
 
the reason for this is basically that consumer protection law in the uk which i think, please correct me if i'm wrong, contradicts printful's policy of returns (i.e. customers can't return a product out of customers remorse, etc, only if the product is faulty, misprinted etc).
so just selling to the usa is easier so i don't need to worry about whether that law applies to me or not (better safe then sorry sort of thing).

so i just need to temp check: is this happening to anyone else? i would imagine they were backed up on embroidery orders, but i have embroidered hats shipping out fine super consistently - do they seem backed up on embroidered apparel orders to anyone? does it seem like it really did get lost and the other one is just a coincidence that it's taking a while?

i just started a shopify with printful and was pleasantly surprised to see good success. as we all know, printful's prices are high and i've had to make my store's prices very high to adjust for this. but when i tried to calculate my true profit for the first week, i saw that i had barely made anything due to printful's taxes.

i pay tax on every item i buy on printful, but my customer doesn't. i do not want to bake these fees into my store's price as then the prices would seem absurd, i would much rather have each individual customer just pay the tax and that go directly to printful.

i messed with my tax settings and added taxjar to shopify, and i see that my store is now charging tax on all the items. but i'm confused on where exactly that money would go, wouldn't that just go to the state? and if not, i assume it's very illegal to collect ""tax"" money and not give that to the government?

i saw that if upload a resale certificate to printful, they won't charge you sales tax on your orders. but on the site ([https://www.printful.com/dashboard/billing/resale-certificates](https://www.printful.com/dashboard/billing/resale-certificates)), i see that it asks me for an id number for every single state.

i filed for a tax permit in texas (my business' location) and am waiting for my permit for a long 3 weeks before i can upload it as a resale certificate to printify. do i have to do that for every single state? that seems extremely difficult to do. if it's just not charging me tax on orders from texas, that doesn't really do much for me as i sell all over the u.s. 

i would really love any insight, advice, or experience on this. without figuring this out, my store's margins just don't make sense. i really want to avoid baking the taxes into my price, because then i'm selling a mug for $20+. i'd much rather my checkout say $16.99 + tax vs like a $20 flat fee.

i'm sorry if i'm not explaining this well, i've tried to research this for hours and still feel completely lost.

""am setting up my first shipping profile and it looks like they may have made some changes already. for the transit time, it has a drop down of choices but all of them are shorter options ranging form 1-2 days up to 5-8 days, it doesn't have the 14-28 days shown in your video. the first provider and product i am trying to set up has a shipping time of 6-9 days so none of these transit times fit into what they offer, what should i do in that situation? also, in the region section it separates out my state into its own section and it wont allow me to put it in with the other states. as a result it has a shorter transit time listed, the longest option it gives me is 2-4 days since it probably thinks i am shipping from my state, which i am not. this could potentially make all my shipments seem like they are late...""

there's no options for different kinds of shipping on this product. but it is telling me that there's an error where it can't send the order to colorway because i've picked economy shipping. when i check my listing it says standard shipping and then on my printify invoice it says standard shipping $0 (instead of the usual price next to standard shipping)

i've already been in a chat with the printify team and they said they put in an it ticket 2 days ago but i'm worried that the time is going to run out for me to have the item printed and sent to my customer. when i follow the link that printify sent me to fix the order, there's literally no options to choose from under shipping (it's just a blank gray box with no buttons) this is true on my existing listing or if i create a new listing for the same brand of mug. i checked creating a new listing because i thought maybe there had been a site update and my listing was somehow obsolete but listings are broken for that product either way.

other kinds of listings like t-shirts, the printing options still work just fine. that makes me think it's not a problem with my account but with that product fulfilled by colorway. i also just logged into printify from my personal google account and tried to create a listing from that brand mug and shipping is still blank if i go to do a manual order.

i really would rather not switch to another brand because i ordered test prints from colorway to make sure the quality was what i wanted and other brands i tried did not do a good job. 

has anyone had any experience with this happening or with the print if i help people having to place an it ticket for you? i'm hoping since it appears to be a problem with the product that it would be a priority for them because it would affect any customer that tried to order this, but once again i'm just really concerned that they're not going to figure it out in time for me to fulfill my customers order.",0,listing broken in printify for one certain product they said they put in a tech ticket 2 day ago,i have a listing on my etsy store that s linked to printify it is based on the white ceramic mug 11 oz by generic brand that is fulfilled by colorway there s no option for different kind of shipping on this product but it is telling me that there s an error where it can t send the order to colorway because i ve picked economy shipping when i check my listing it say standard shipping and then on my printify invoice it say standard shipping 0 instead of the usual price next to standard shipping i ve already been in a chat with the printify team and they said they put in an it ticket 2 day ago but i m worried that the time is going to run out for me to have the item printed and sent to my customer when i follow the link that printify sent me to fix the order there s literally no option to choose from under shipping it s just a blank gray box with no button this is true on my existing listing or if i create a new listing for the same brand of mug i checked creating a new listing because i thought maybe there had been a site update and my listing wa somehow obsolete but listing are broken for that product either way other kind of listing like t shirt the printing option still work just fine that make me think it s not a problem with my account but with that product fulfilled by colorway i also just logged into printify from my personal google account and tried to create a listing from that brand mug and shipping is still blank if i go to do a manual order i really would rather not switch to another brand because i ordered test print from colorway to make sure the quality wa what i wanted and other brand i tried did not do a good job ha anyone had any experience with this happening or with the print if i help people having to place an it ticket for you i m hoping since it appears to be a problem with the product that it would be a priority for them because it would affect any customer that tried to order this but once again i m just really concerned that they re not going to figure it out in time for me to fulfill my customer order,96,19,99,19,2061,413,2109,399

i'm specifically looking for a heavyweight white-colored t-shirt that isn't see-through or super thin and flimsy.

if you have experience with any of the following models, i'd love to have some feedback.

>\- gildan 2000 ultra cotton 

>\- bella+canvas 3001

>\- american apparel 1301

>\- next level 3600 

>\- hanes beefy-t 5180

from the few pictures i've seen online it seems like the next level 3600 is quite see-through so i might stay away from it. i'm obviously not interested in showing my beautiful nipples to the whole world.

which one of those would be your best in terms of overall quality and fit ?

purpose : to provide a highly realistic, ai-generated rendering of the product that closely matches the actual item. the images are crafted to accurately reflect the product's style, fit, details, dimensions, and ect, ensuring customers have a clear and lifelike visual representation. while minor variations in color or details may occur in real life, the ai rendering is designed to deliver a precise and reliable preview of the product's real-life appearance.

(not asking about the colors or background ect, that can be changed easily and will depend on item, but more about the quality specifically. would you use this ? thank you very much for you feedback.)

edit : i had a lot of requests so i took a few days to set up a website for digital downloads, i uploaded gildan 18000 mockups today (i don't even know if i can say this here ?? ik i can't add a link so come to chat and i'll give you the link)

1161,The Best BFCM Email Marketing Guide,2,1g2j8j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1g2j8j5/the_best_bfcm_email_marketing_guide/,0,2024-10-13 13:06:43,"**black friday/cyber monday email marketing guide**

every year i make a post on here for bfcm based on my experience managing email/sms marketing for hundreds of brands. i always try to add the new things i‚Äôve learned to improve the quality of the posts i made on reddit last year.

this guide is targeted at store owners doing at least 25k+ per month, with an email list that has over 1500 people. if your store doesn‚Äôt meet these requirements, you‚Äôll still learn a thing or 2 from this post & if you‚Äôre doing 250k+ per month, i'm sure your marketing for the most important month of the year is probably already sorted. so, for all you entrepreneurs in the middle, don‚Äôt fumble this. a well-executed q4 can easily add 40% to your business's annual revenue.

¬†

**this is what you can do to improve your deliverability and conversion rate for bfcm:**

1. **segment your list** - treat your vip customers and your non-buyers differently. vips get early access and special treatment‚Äîthey should feel appreciated for supporting your brand in the past & encouraged to do it again. now is the time to make a push to get people who bought last year ( around this time ) onto your sms list. i‚Äôm going to say some real shit. sms will never be as good as emails, but if there‚Äôs 1 month where it makes sense to double down on sms marketing it's november.
2. **write good subject lines** - your subject line needs to stop people in their tracks. i‚Äôve said this plenty of times, and i‚Äôll say it again. there are 2 ways to create a good subject line. either you‚Äôre extremely direct and say something like ""our black friday sale starts now! get 20% off everything!"" or you create curiosity with something like ‚Äúwe‚Äôre giving away gifts to people in {{customers\_city}}‚Äù (the ‚Äúgift‚Äù can simply be a free add-on with purchases over x amount. bonus points for personalizing the subject line, it‚Äôll boost the open rate)
3. **design clean, eye-catching emails -** use templates if you don‚Äôt have a designer (hello, canva). make sure your emails are branded, easy to read, and mobile-friendly. include urgency with countdown timers (sendtric makes it easy to embed timers), and stick to one clear cta (call to action). whether the customer is looking for a christmas gift or just a good deal, the email needs to flow in a way that ends with them checking out on your site.
4. **create urgency** - use language that creates fomo. set clear start and end dates for your sale, and send reminders as the end approaches. time-sensitive offers work best‚Äîlet them know stock is limited, and they need to act fast. there's no better time to use scarcity and urgency than during bfcm. go all out.
5. **optimize for deliverability -** don‚Äôt blast out emails to your entire list at once, especially if you haven‚Äôt been emailing regularly (you can send to your full list if you have less than 5k members on it). segment and prioritize your engaged subscribers to improve your chances of landing in the inbox instead of the spam folder.

¬†

**here‚Äôs a basic sending schedule for november:**

**1. november 1 - holiday opt-out email**

* a courtesy email offering customers the chance to opt out of holiday promotions to maintain high engagement. an unengaged subscriber hurts you more than they help you.

**2. november 5 - early access vip announcement**

* notify vip customers about their exclusive early access to upcoming black friday sales to create excitement and reward loyalty.

**3. november 9 - black friday sneak peek**

* tease your audience with a preview of your best black friday deals, building anticipation with a countdown to the sale. this is your chance to show off new collections and this leads perfectly into the hype email.

**4. november 15 - hype email**

* build excitement as black friday approaches, reminding everyone of the upcoming sale and highlighting a few top deals to create buzz.

**5. november 20 - vip early access launch**

* grant early access to your black friday sale for vip customers, emphasizing exclusivity and creating urgency with limited stock and timeframes.

**6. november 24 - black friday sale launch**

* officially launch your black friday sale with a bold, straightforward email promoting the biggest discounts and encouraging immediate action.

**7. november 27 - black friday reminder email**

* send a reminder that black friday deals are ending soon, using urgency and fomo to prompt last-minute purchases.

**8. november 30 - cyber monday sale launch**

* kick off your cyber monday sale with new deals, offering customers another chance to shop and promoting items left from black friday.

**9.¬†december 5- thank you email**

* this is by far the most important email of the year. it's so important i made an entire post about it. this is your chance to send out a plain text email and simply express gratitude to your customers. i‚Äôve sent this email nearly 100 times, it almost always outperforms every email that was sent out during the entire year. it is by far, the most lucrative email i‚Äôve ever sent out. don‚Äôt forget to say thank you.

",0,printify shopify store losing money on each order need help,hi guy i have a store i started month ago through shopify where i make product and use print provider through printify to fullfill these order i thought this wa going to be amazing because i odn t have to pay anything until the customer purchase i ve been experiencing thing that i don t understand and the community online is hard to get answer and i am by no mean a professional i key in 40 profit margin and have customer pay for the shipping yet each order there is a shortfall between what im paid and what i have too pay printify it just doesnt make sense i m losing money to try and make money there is a production cost a well i m not sure if that ha anything to do with it am i making the wrong assumption that if i have a product i mark it up 40 and customer pay for shipping how doe this keep happening why aren t i making 40 i also feel like printify provider lie because it will say something like 10 shipping in canada and then next thing you know i make a profduct and have to redo it becaus ewhen i do a mock checkout it will say something ridiculous like 30 shipping which no one is going to think about even for a second really looking for some experienced and specific help to my problem i ve been looking into shipping profile but there too many of them i have 25 product i pick the shipping profile which is the company of each item so i m not sure how the number keep getting edited after the sale thanks in advance im out about 1000 and might have to just close this business after month of work marketing a business license etc great stuff to offer the world but it seems impossible to find a balance that work for all three party and i could nenver do all this without the provider it would just be digital image i feel like this shouldn t be rocket science but printify make it that way to take our money they dont even have a phone number to call and their thread and faq are ridiculously unhelpful the photo i m attaching is actually the sale with the least amount of money lost yet but still thanks http preview redd it r24fg8rgwltd1 jpg width 434 format pjpg auto webp s 162aa67fc0f347b35e0dbe3d2136af77f8260c20 http preview redd it u8flr7rgwltd1 jpg width 938 format pjpg auto webp s 859dcb8434bf470a6f3f528cf55eef04da64b745,59,10,62,10,2255,427,2337,391

(it's a simple gildan 5000).

has anyone seen this happen? we reached out to printify who said they can't replicate the issue and as long as it's from their tiktok-listed items, it will be good to go, but we still see these strange issue. it's concerning to us seeing this and don't want to get any violations out of the gates because of something not set up correctly.

* i just retested this issue with another image and found the same issue. this time i made the default image the smallest at 8x10 inches. i uploaded the other file sizes to my printify library and created their variants (11x14, 16x20 & 20x30). this time, once in the product's variants & layers panel section, every time i clicked on a file other than the 8x10 default version, the dpi decreased to unacceptable levels. *it seems that all 4 variants are based on whichever file is chosen to be the default image.* if this is correct, it means printify only uses one file, the default file, to create all the other variants through some type of resizing algorithm. for a single puzzle product, i want to be able to upload 4 separate image files, one for each size variant.  i suppose i could use one file for the 16x20 and 8x10 since the aspect ratios are basically the same, but the 20x30 version has an aspect ratio that is not compatible with the others, and needs its own separate file.
* if i can't utilize multiple files to create the variants for my puzzle products, i don't see how i'll be able to use printify as my pod provider for puzzles.  i imagine this same issue might be encountered when creating wall art products.  any help, insight and info will be greatly appreciated!",0,doe printify accept multiple file for one product,i recently sent a help request to printify i thought i d also post my question here while i m waiting to hear back from the review team i m new to printify and want to create some pod puzzle i uploaded 4 separate file for the 4 available puzzle size for one puzzle product in the variant layer panel the dpi for my default design changed every time i added a variant this shouldn t be happening the default design is based on it own unique file which is sized correctly when i click back on the the default it reverts back to the proper 300 dpi setting but a i click on each of the other size the default variant dpi keep increasing i want to confirm that there isn t some weird interpolation going on with the default file please see the attachment for greater clarity i just retested this issue with another image and found the same issue this time i made the default image the smallest at 8x10 inch i uploaded the other file size to my printify library and created their variant 11x14 16x20 20x30 this time once in the product s variant layer panel section every time i clicked on a file other than the 8x10 default version the dpi decreased to unacceptable level it seems that all 4 variant are based on whichever file is chosen to be the default image if this is correct it mean printify only us one file the default file to create all the other variant through some type of resizing algorithm for a single puzzle product i want to be able to upload 4 separate image file one for each size variant i suppose i could use one file for the 16x20 and 8x10 since the aspect ratio are basically the same but the 20x30 version ha an aspect ratio that is not compatible with the others and need it own separate file if i can t utilize multiple file to create the variant for my puzzle product i don t see how i ll be able to use printify a my pod provider for puzzle i imagine this same issue might be encountered when creating wall art product any help insight and info will be greatly appreciated,49,8,52,8,1995,382,2091,378

my question is- do people really spend this much money on these products? for example, my first shop idea was selling luxury wrapping paper, but after designing and creating the listing etc i just couldn't bring myself to believe that anybody would actually pay ~$20 for a couple of sheets of wrapping paper, not even considering shipping! so i gave up before i even started really, as i didn't want to waste my time.
now i'm working on opening my ebay store selling kitchenware through printify and again, i've designed a tea towel (which i personally would buy myself as i think it's nicely aesthetically pleasing) but to get $8 profit i have to sell for $22!!
do i just have a broke b*tch mentality? or do people really spend this kind of money on stuff like this? i personally can't imagine spending anything over $8 for a basic sublimation printed mug, regardless of how good the design is, but here i am preparing to sell them for $15!

on printify i'm looking to create some corkback coasters. i have a series of about 20 images i'd like to offer in a single etsy listing, all themed around the same thing. i found the ""hack"" to add multiple sku's to one etsy listing that way i can have all the coasters in one listing and the customer can add as many as they'd like for their particular taste to their cart. all these are from the same printify provider.

my question is:

if i add these ~20 drink coaster sku's, from the same printify provider, to my etsy listing... will i get the ""additional shipping cost discount"" if a customer orders say... 6 coasters?

one coaster is about $6 for shipping costs, but each additional coaster is $1. i'm not finding anywhere that states for the additional shipping cost each additional coaster needs to be the same exact design... and i assume since they're all going to the same place, even though they're different designs/prints, that each coaster past the first one should qualify for the $1/coaster shipping discount, correct?

i just don't want to spend time creating 20 different printify products and attaching all their sku's to one listing and then get a customer that orders 10 coasters in one order and i'm getting charged $6/coaster to ship them. obviously that's not a winning business model.

hoping someone has experience with how printify treats these situations. thanks!",0,shipping multiple item question,hey team have a somewhat convoluted question that i hope there s an easy answer for on printify i m looking to create some corkback coaster i have a series of about 20 image i d like to offer in a single etsy listing all themed around the same thing i found the hack to add multiple sku s to one etsy listing that way i can have all the coaster in one listing and the customer can add a many a they d like for their particular taste to their cart all these are from the same printify provider my question is if i add these 20 drink coaster sku s from the same printify provider to my etsy listing will i get the additional shipping cost discount if a customer order say 6 coaster one coaster is about 6 for shipping cost but each additional coaster is 1 i m not finding anywhere that state for the additional shipping cost each additional coaster need to be the same exact design and i assume since they re all going to the same place even though they re different design print that each coaster past the first one should qualify for the 1 coaster shipping discount correct i just don t want to spend time creating 20 different printify product and attaching all their sku s to one listing and then get a customer that order 10 coaster in one order and i m getting charged 6 coaster to ship them obviously that s not a winning business model hoping someone ha experience with how printify treat these situation thanks,31,4,34,5,1417,270,1480,254

**monster digital**

*issues:*

* cant do any type of textures / distressing good (i tested the 2 prints with monster and swift one of the ones monster digital did, didn't do any of the distressing texture (swift did) and on the other it was like random small blotches of ink taken out instead of the distressed texture
* about half of the prints have been misaligned with the white underbase. on one print the white underboss on text made it look blurry
* there were other minor issues but not noteworthy
* another separate sample order had cracking and peeling in 2 of my samples.

*the good:*

* the colors came out a little more accurate than swiftpod and a couple of the others i tested (though printful's came out the best).
* the speed in which it went from purchase to delivered was only about 5 days



**swiftpod**

*issues:*

* the colors were way off on 1 of the prints.
* on another print the colors were off as well and it they even printed white in some spots that were suppose to be blue. (i did the same exact design with multiple other providers and no other ones had that issue)
* overall there colors were off at least for my sample order.

*the good:*

* did one of my design really well and handled the textured / distressed designs good as well (not fully textured but close). also the colors looked a little better but its hard to judge as this design i used very muted colors to begin with.
* the shipping was also the same speed a monster digital



**underground threads**

*the good*

i only tested one sample with them as they don't carry many products i am looking for at the moment. i will say the print came out great so i wish they did cary the other stuff i wanted to sell.

*minor complaint:*

* the only minor issue i had was that on the sample i got the whole front of the shirt was rough (the shirt itself without the print). i thought it might have been the fabric but the back of the shirt was not rough.



**macro fine arts:**

* only had one sample on a sweatshirt, came out good so no complaints. i wish i would have gotten a sample with my test design on the same shirts as the others though.



**fulfill engine**

* also tested fulfill engine and there shirts have an odd glue, paint smell (no like the vinegar smell). one print came out horrible cracked and peeling, the whole printing was the roughest i've felt on all samples. on the other sample it came out good, still rough and still had that smell. if anyone know what im talking about can you explain to me why that is.



so i wrote all this to share my limited experience with my samples. id like to know if any of you with more experience, which providers do you feel are the best quality of prints for shirts.

today i made a test with an extra etsy account to see what happens with shipping calculations if i add a t-shirt and a hoodie to the same cart. in this case etsy chose the hoodie shipping template like if the order were 2 hoodies, so i'd loose money by not charging the t-shirt shipping correctly.

how do you deal with this? free shipping?

i was not choosing to use free shipping in the case the client wanted to buy more than one of the same item, since additional products costs in most cases half of the shipping for one item, and with free shipping they would pay the hole shipping price.

should i configure free shipping for all my products? i don't know what to do! i read your comments!

thank you! ‚ô•

1397,Is there an elegant solution yet for Same-Listing Etsy order routing for US/EU providers?,1,1f4m214,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1f4m214/is_there_an_elegant_solution_yet_for_samelisting/,4,2024-08-30 10:57:01,"i've read a number of threads and help articles on this topic, and it still seems like a mess.

printify's tutorial page explained to create two unpublished (us & eu) listings within printify, and the real listing on etsy. when an order is received, manually import that order into printify, using either your us or eu product.

heck, i've even seen to make three, four even five duplicate listings, for example canada or australia.

not only is this archaic, but defeats the purpose of any automation or efficiency.

it also states that ""alternatively"", you can use **order routing** instead.

however a deeper dive on people's experience on order routing claimed this still only applies within a certain region, and does not apply to using a single etsy->printify live, published listing, aka, selecting a us-based provider and having it route to an eu-based provider if the etsy customer is in the eu.

however.. printify's own example again seems to contradict this:  
""you received an order from a customer in germany for a t-shirt from a us-based print provider. we'll automatically send the order to a comparable provider located in europe to fulfill the order, when available.""

it sounds to me like you can choose a us-based provider in printify, market your etsy listing as us & eu, and when printify receives an eu order, it will route behind-the-scenes to an equivalent eu provider.

if this is true, i'm not sure why half a dozen threads *all recommend the double/triple listing hack*. apparently this is what people are doing out there.

i upload an image file to a printify product listing (i tried png, jpg and svg). after upload it states ""high resolution (300 dpi)"". looking at the mockups in preview mode and downloading them i have issues with some areas of text getting distorted.  
you can see that in the image i have uploaded - especially around the bottom part of the os and also the n in ""brown"". you can also see it at in the z in ""lazy"".  
if you just have a quick look at the mockup in the size that printify provides it for download this does not catch the eye immediately. but if you look closer it is there. now i understand that these are mockups and not print files but in regards to how important the main mockup of a product is for atttracing buyers on the likes of etsy and so on, i wonder if that can be good for potential buyers to see - even if the print on the final product will be fine.

has anybody seen this problem before and knows how to solve that?

i have tried various fonts (from bold to light) and sizes. this happens everywhere.

does anyone know what i could be doing wrong?

1. i have an e-commerce page on my website i'm about to launch.
2. the page will sell print-on-demand items from printify, and digital items will also be available for immediate download. 
3. the store is built using wordpress and woocommerce.
4. i'm based in illinois.
5. i have woocommerce set to collect taxes based on the shipping address. 
6. when i tested, the store only collected taxes on products shipped to illinois and not to any other state. (i understand this since il is my home state, and i don't currently have nexus with any other state.)
7. even though i don't have nexus with any other state, printify will still collect taxes for any state where a product i sell is shipped. that means if i sell a product that gets shipped to new york, printify will collect taxes for new york, but my site won't show those taxes to the customer because my site doesn't specifically have nexus with new york, and woocommerce doesn't think i need to collect new york sales tax.
8. i don't have resale licenses for other states, so i am not exempt from printify collecting taxes.

is my understanding above correct? if so, here are my questions.

1. if my site doesn't show and charge taxes for products shipped outside of illinois, won't printify take the tax amount out of my account anyway, thus reducing my profit?
2. is there a free way to show and charge taxes for products shipped outside of illinois using woocommerce before reaching nexus, aside from manually entering a tax rate for each state (and keeping up with it)? i looked at taxcloud, but it appears that also only applied taxes for illinois, not every state where printify will collect tax.
3. if there's no cost-free way to apply taxes on my site, can i do this with taxjar, or will that also only apply sales tax where i have nexus?

  
i posted something similar on woocommerce but didn't get a good answer, so i'm hoping someone using printify and woocommerce has already gone through this. thanks.",0,printify tax collection process question with woocommerce not asking for tax advice,i m not asking for tax advice i want to understand the prinfity tax collection process before spending more money 1 i have an e commerce page on my website i m about to launch 2 the page will sell printondemand item from printify and digital item will also be available for immediate download 3 the store is built using wordpress and woocommerce 4 i m based in illinois 5 i have woocommerce set to collect tax based on the shipping address 6 when i tested the store only collected tax on product shipped to illinois and not to any other state i understand this since il is my home state and i don t currently have nexus with any other state 7 even though i don t have nexus with any other state printify will still collect tax for any state where a product i sell is shipped that mean if i sell a product that get shipped to new york printify will collect tax for new york but my site won t show those tax to the customer because my site doesn t specifically have nexus with new york and woocommerce doesn t think i need to collect new york sale tax 8 i don t have resale license for other state so i am not exempt from printify collecting tax is my understanding above correct if so here are my question 1 if my site doesn t show and charge tax for product shipped outside of illinois won t printify take the tax amount out of my account anyway thus reducing my profit 2 is there a free way to show and charge tax for product shipped outside of illinois using woocommerce before reaching nexus aside from manually entering a tax rate for each state and keeping up with it i looked at taxcloud but it appears that also only applied tax for illinois not every state where printify will collect tax 3 if there s no cost free way to apply tax on my site can i do this with taxjar or will that also only apply sale tax where i have nexus i posted something similar on woocommerce but didn t get a good answer so i m hoping someone using printify and woocommerce ha already gone through this thanks,83,12,84,11,1995,387,2089,369

so i'm new to printify and shopify. here's what happened:

i placed a real, live order for a mug on my site. i paid for shipping and of course the product including the retail price. 

the order of course then went to printify but i had to pay for shipping again in printify. :( i understand that i as the store owner placed an order so i'm paying for the shipping as a ""customer"", but in my order total in printify, the price i had to cover to have it produced was the production cost and the shipping cost. 

i thought the customer pays the shipping from printify? or in other words, the shipping cost i paid on the live site with shopify i thought would cover the shipping cost that printify wants?

i'm wondering if this is normal or is it because of my shipping profile in shopify?

this is one of the shirts that got cancelled, i'm not using the word ""ariel"" with a picture of a mermaid, it's just in a box on a shirt, is that enough to infringe on disney's trademark which is specific to their ownership of the little mermaid as they told it?

but then the same printer had no issue printing the second snow white x scarface inspired shirt.

  
\*update\* so the original order that was getting cancelled was 3 shirts. the ariel ""box logo"", the rapunzel/pascal campaign tee, and the tron tee below. i placed a new order, in my wife's name, through tiktok shop for just the rapunzel tee, and it went through to the original printer no issue, they even printed it already and it seems to have shipped.  

i placed a new order for those same three tees from a different provider on printify, and it's been in production for about 12 hours (vs. the original cancelling provider was cancelling within an hour) so we'll see if it actually goes through....

what am i missing?

update 7/31/24:  
i ordered some samples from monster digital via printify last week & they arrive last night. b+c 3001 in black - turned out great. crisp knockouts, good halftones, no hazing. looks better in person that in the photo - fabric is a great dark black (darker than the gildan 5000 i also ordered) and colors really pop. really happy with it, just can't use printify's mockups in the listings.

also opened a support ticket with printify and sent them a bunch of samples & design files - they're looking into it but no word yet.

1. **create a full ecommerce site** on shopify, woocommerce, bigcommerce and integrate printify as fulfilment provider. this gives you more control over branding and seo, but requires more setup and costs compared to the pop-up store.
2. **buy a custom domain and forward it** to your printify store. found this guy using a custom domain in his instagram. https://www.instagram.com/exmorobo/. this is allows less customization for sure since your site is not on shopify or woo. however, the same link can be used as website address in future if you decide to move to a shopify store. this in my opinion is wiser unless you are starting with huge budget. you can find cheap ways to get a domain name on go daddy, link.store, etc.

i am a new etsy seller in the us, and i just received an order from germany. i have only had 10 sales so far, and i had decided to think about international sales later and focus on domestic until my feet are wet. apparently i didn't set that up that correctly. (if anybody can help me change this, i'd be very grateful.) 

on the order in etsy, there's a note: ""you must share etsy's ioss number, \[xyz\], with your courier for this order (use it only for this purpose). this helps ensure that your buyer won't be charged vat twice. make sure to write the value of this order in euros, on your package, too.""

i'm facing some challenges with printing orders through printify and could really use some advice from experienced designers or anyone familiar with custom printing processes.

i've been using printify for my recent orders of posters and t-shirts, but i've encountered issues with the design sizes not matching the mockups as expected. specifically, the designs are being centered or scaled down unexpectedly due to factors like the white background being detected as part of the design and the system's automatic scaling for different apparel sizes.

i've already reached out to printify's support team, and while they've provided some insights, the current solutions don't fully meet my expectations for design placement and consistency across different shirt sizes.

here are my main concerns:
- how can i ensure that my designs are printed accurately on the right chest area without unnecessary centering or scaling issues even if i take away the white background? 
- is there a way to customize the print settings to maintain the intended size and placement more precisely?
- should i consider handling the printing myself to have more control over the final product, and if so, what equipment or services would you recommend for diy printing?

if anyone has experience with similar issues or can offer advice on alternative printing services or diy solutions, i would greatly appreciate your insights. my goal is to deliver the best possible quality to my clients while navigating these printing challenges.

i personally send out over 1000 email campaigns every year for various brands. the 1 email that brings in the most money for each brand, every year, is a plain text email. forget your fancy black friday email with gifs and html timers, my plain text email from the ‚Äúceo‚Äù will outperform that email every single time. i previously made a whole post about how to set this email up but, in a nutshell, it‚Äôs a heartfelt plain-text thank-you email that goes out sometimes during q4. the real key is just being genuine.

now i‚Äôll explain 5 reasons why plain text emails outperform other emails most of the time.

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **deliverability**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **spam filters**: plain text emails are less likely to be flagged by spam filters compared to html emails, which often contain images, links, and various formatting elements that can trigger spam alerts.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **inbox placement**: plain text emails are more likely to land directly in the recipient‚Äôs primary inbox rather than being relegated to the promotions or spam folders.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **makes you stand out**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **outsmart your competition:** i can almost guarantee your competitors don‚Äôt regularly send out plain text emails. you can stand out by simply being different. always remember, that great marketing has the perfect blend of creativity and simplicity. the combination of landing in the primary inbox, having a good subject line, and compelling copywriting can put you light years ahead of your competition. this leads me to my next point.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **compatibility and readability**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **simplicity**: plain text emails have a clean and simple appearance, which can make them easier to read. the lack of distractions like images and flashy design elements helps recipients focus on the message content. plain text emails are universally compatible with all customer's devices.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **loading speed**: plain text emails load faster since they don't contain heavy images or complex html code, which is especially important for recipients with slow internet connections or limited data plans.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **it's more personal**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **personal feel**: in plain text emails, it is your duty to just talk like people like they‚Äôre people. don‚Äôt pretend to be someone else like ‚Äúsarah from customer service‚Äù. you are the ceo personally reaching out to your beloved customers. people will respect you for being transparent, this will ultimately improve your relationship with customers. people perceive plain text emails as more authentic and trustworthy compared to heavily designed emails that might look overly promotional.

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **engagement metrics**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **higher open rates**: because they often look more like a personal email from a friend or colleague, plain text emails may achieve higher open rates. a good subject line can make a huge difference in open rates.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **click-through rates**: with fewer distractions, the call-to-action in a plain text email can stand out more, potentially leading to higher click-through rates.

to wrap this up. the fancy emails are still good. they make you look legit, they are great for branding, and you can leverage media to build trust. i recommend still having a beautiful email template available, but there are large brands like sticker mule that only send plain text emails and they are doing very well. they're probably pulling in more revenue from emails than most of their competitors. moral of the story is don‚Äôt stress too much about always having perfect graphics. your customers will appreciate a plain text email once in a while.",0,why plain text email outperform fancy email,if you re not sending out email because you feel like you don t have time this post is for you sending out weekly newsletter can be a lot simpler than you think plain text email are not only easier to create but they also outperform fancy image based email most of the time i personally send out over 1000 email campaign every year for various brand the 1 email that brings in the most money for each brand every year is a plain text email forget your fancy black friday email with gifs and html timer my plain text email from the ceo will outperform that email every single time i previously made a whole post about how to set this email up but in a nutshell it s a heartfelt plain text thank you email that go out sometimes during q4 the real key is just being genuine now i ll explain 5 reason why plain text email outperform other email most of the time 1 deliverability spam filter plain text email are le likely to be flagged by spam filter compared to html email which often contain image link and various formatting element that can trigger spam alert inbox placement plain text email are more likely to land directly in the recipient s primary inbox rather than being relegated to the promotion or spam folder 2 make you stand out outsmart your competition i can almost guarantee your competitor don t regularly send out plain text email you can stand out by simply being different always remember that great marketing ha the perfect blend of creativity and simplicity the combination of landing in the primary inbox having a good subject line and compelling copywriting can put you light year ahead of your competition this lead me to my next point 3 compatibility and readability simplicity plain text email have a clean and simple appearance which can make them easier to read the lack of distraction like image and flashy design element help recipient focus on the message content plain text email are universally compatible with all customer s device loading speed plain text email load faster since they don t contain heavy image or complex html code which is especially important for recipient with slow internet connection or limited data plan 4 it s more personal personal feel in plain text email it is your duty to just talk like people like they re people don t pretend to be someone else like sarah from customer service you are the ceo personally reaching out to your beloved customer people will respect you for being transparent this will ultimately improve your relationship with customer people perceive plain text email a more authentic and trustworthy compared to heavily designed email that might look overly promotional 5 engagement metric higher open rate because they often look more like a personal email from a friend or colleague plain text email may achieve higher open rate a good subject line can make a huge difference in open rate click through rate with fewer distraction the call to action in a plain text email can stand out more potentially leading to higher click through rate to wrap this up the fancy email are still good they make you look legit they are great for branding and you can leverage medium to build trust i recommend still having a beautiful email template available but there are large brand like sticker mule that only send plain text email and they are doing very well they re probably pulling in more revenue from email than most of their competitor moral of the story is don t stress too much about always having perfect graphic your customer will appreciate a plain text email once in a while,43,7,45,7,3559,630,3863,618

this is strange as when i first created the listings, the image quality for all sizes was more than high enough. i even sent a few test products to friends and had orders come through of the sizes printify is now claiming aren't high quality enough and all the pieces arrived beautifully clear and full of detail.

i've looked at every listing i have and it is an issue for every singie one now ü´†

i'm hoping someone can help me figure out what is happening here. when i zoom into my images in the printify editor while creating a product, in this case posters, they are blurry. i've created 5 different listings, all of which come in 7 different dimensions. i have used multiple version of the files, for example i've made 7 different files of each image to match the dimensions of each version. no matter what version of the image i'm using, it's blurry. i'm linking a section of an image below, versus what printify shows. the image i created is a 300 dpi image. when it is scaled to fit the printify dimensions it goes up to 552 dpi (according to the editor at least).

the files i'm using are all jpeg format if that helps. i did try saving the file as a png instead and it seems to have marginally increased the quality showing in the editor but it is still not near the actual image quality i'm uploading. just to clarify because my google search results seem to mostly focus on mockups being blurry. this is the actual product layout editor i'm having the issue with.

any insight into why this is happening would be appreciated.

i've just set up a pop up store and while reviewing all the settings, i saw that there's a 30% tax being withheld from my payouts. 

i contacted the support center about it and they came up with a generic answer, but when i started digging deeper, they changed the reason for that 30%.

originally, they said they'd withhold that amount and send it to the tax services of my country (switzerland) because i am required to pay taxes on my sales. i told them that didn't make sense because switzerland does not tax revenue that high, and what would happen with the surplus?

they then changed their answer and said that 30% is actually sent to the irs in the states... what? so, i need to pay revenue taxes in the states even though i live in europe and sell internationally? if that's the case, i am being taxed twice on the same revenue, once in the us and once here. what's left of my profit then?

also, my store is just to give my followers a way to support me (i am a musician). i sell maybe 100$ worth of profit by year... i am not making millions here.

is there a threshold that activates that 30% tax? meaning, does that tax only come into play if i sell for more than a specific amount of $ throughout the year, or do i have to pay it only if i've made a couple bucks?

now about the sales tax : i read online that, for example in kentucky, i need to sell for 100k or more (or 200 transactions) before i need to comply with the sales tax laws but that changes state by state. since i will never sell for that amount, is there a way to avoid that tax?

i tried this with 6 products ( blueprint id's: 12, 706, 710, 77, 49, 1296; print provider id: 39) - it works on 3 of them (blueprint id's: 706, 710, 1296; print provider id: 39) and fails on the other 3 (blueprint id's: 12, 77, 49; print provider id: 39). the only difference between the products that i can see is that on the products that it failed, there were 3-5 print area positions ( front, back, left\_sleeve, neck, etc..); and on the ones that it succeeded, there were only 2 available print positions ( front, back) - but, that shouldn't matter because in all the cases, i just updated the position = ""front""

the payload is the same in all of the cases (except the variant id's that were updated - essentially: 3-5 sets of variant id's, representing a specified color gets a new image, which is uploaded into the media library before hand

the url used for the request is:  {base\_url}shops/{shop\_id}/products/{product\_id}.json'

the headers used is: headers = {

'authorization': f'bearer {printify\_api\_key}',

'content-type': 'application/json'

1746,How to double your revenue from email campaigns ,5,1dbm9us,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1dbm9us/how_to_double_your_revenue_from_email_campaigns/,8,2024-06-09 12:25:05,"this post is all about deliverability. the basic math equation is simple. more people will buy from your emails if more people see your emails. so if your open rates are below 20%, you can probably double them by just following the basic tips i give you below.

with that being said, let's get started.

here are 10 things you should avoid doing regularly if you want to have good deliverability:

1. don‚Äôt keep unengaged members on your email list. if your business isn't seasonal and someone hasn't opened your emails in over 6 months you should consider either reducing the volume of emails that are sent to them or completely removing them from your email list. they will bring your open rates down and this will increase your chances of being marketed as spam.

1. break your list down. segmentation does not matter if you have less than 2k emails. but once you get to 10k+ emails you‚Äôll need these 4 basic segments: buyers, non-buyer, engaged customers, and non-engaged customers. you can personalize emails based on what they have bought/viewed. this alone will significantly boost your open rates. think of it like this, what‚Äôs more likely to be opened? free shipping on everything today only or you‚Äôre in lucküé≤ ‚Äì free shipping for the next 6 hours in {{users\_city}} (while recommending items that they have viewed recently in the email)

1. beware of spam filters - did you know that you could get blacklisted? if your domain is unhealthy your emails will almost always go directly to spam. it's almost impossible to revive a domain so be careful how you go about sending from your main domain. also if you burnt a domain in the past from 1 ip address it's likely that if you create a new domain using that same ip address your 2nd domain also will be negatively affected. if you use a shifty email sending provider you will also run into spam filter problems.

1. write a good subject line. the subject line is the single most important aspect of email copywriting. there are typically only 2 types of good subject lines. subject lines to make people curious and subject lines that are direct (typically with a good offer). that‚Äôs literally all there is to it. also, don't lead with a misleading subject line. pissing people off is the easiest way to get spam complaints instead of normal unsubscribes. (spam complaints are way worse for deliverability)

1. don't be inconsistent. algorithms love consistency. this is why the number 1 way to boost engagement on almost any social platform ever created is to post consistently and follow some sort of routine. emails aren't different at all. try to email your most engaged segment every week. this will give you a good average open rate and also it will show the email service provider that people interact with your content regularly.

1. don't try to hide the unsubscribe button. not having an unsubscribe button is illegal but some people just try to use cheat codes like making the unsubscribe text white on a white background. this is the easiest way to increase spam complaints greatly. customers should never feel like you're forcing them to do anything.

1. don't send emails from shady domains. you should have a clear professional-looking sender address. use a business domain, not a regular email account. avoid using any random characters anywhere in the domain and do everything you can to make it very clear where the email is coming from.

1. make sure your grammar is on point. typos of any kind can be a red flag for spam filters. it's impossible to be perfect all the time but at least try to make sure your emails have less typos than this reddit post.

1. never buy email lists and use them for b2c marketing. sending to people without their consent is the worst thing that you could possibly do if you're trying to avoid the spam filter. make sure every single email address that is receiving your emails has opted in.

1. don't use spammy copywriting. most people have literally no idea what this means so i put together a list of things that are generally bad. here is the list of things to avoid: using all caps for subject lines, capitalizing every word in your subject lines all the time, using large fonts, using fonts smaller than size 8 font in main bodies of sales copy, overusing words like free or sale in your subject lines and over using emojis.

i want to end this with a reminder that no one is above spam filters. if you go to your spam folder right now you'll probably see at least one 8 figure company stuck in there multiple times. these people hire ""experts"" and pay them thousands every month and still can't figure it out. so just because your emails are doing okay now, just know that can change fast if you are not careful.",0,how

* i intend to ship to the us, canada, australia, new zealand, the united kingdom, and europe.

* a manufacturer from the uk will be used to ship to both the uk and europe.

* a manufacturer from australia will be used to ship to both australia and new zealand.

* manufacturers from the us and canada will be used to ship to their respective countries.



questions:



* income tax:
   * how can i ensure i only pay taxes on profit and not revenue earnings?

* import taxes:
   * is there a way for my european customers not to pay for this apart from me using a european manufacturer (instead of uk manufacturer)?

* canadian taxes:
   * what steps do i need to take?
   * can i claim canadian taxes back?
   * will canada require me to pay taxes on shipping?
   * can canadian taxes on shipping be claimed back(if they exist)?



* usa taxes:
   * do us states charge a tax on shipping?
   * as a uk citizen, can i claim taxes back on both product and shipping(if taxes for shipping exist) ?
      * how can i do this?



* uk taxes
   * i pay the vat tax when paying the manufacturer, right? and my clients also pay vat when purchasing my product, right? and etsy takes care of customer paid taxes, right?
   * can i claim back all business-related taxes that i pay?
   * what if i use my uk manufacturer to ship to europe as well? can i get those taxes back?
      * if yes, is there a different procedure for that?

* australia:
   * australia is not mentioned in the printify section about taxes. do i need to pay taxes for products manufactured in australia?
   * can this tax be claimed back if i live in the uk?
   * does australia have any taxes on shipping and can it be claimed back as well?
   * even when shipping to new zealand?

new zealand:

* do my new zealand customers have to pay import taxes for products shipping from australia?
   * can this be avoided?

* can i claim back taxes paid to australian manufacturers for products shipped to new zealand?



  
also, when applicable, is the tax on shipping paid by each customer at the checkout or by me at the moment of purchase at the printify side? is it included in the price?

however, i don‚Äôt think i can do this on printify. it looks like, however, i can get a different user profile in shopify, and let them edit the content from there, for published products at least. but if i do that, i‚Äôm not sure that they will be able to see unpublished printify items. 

has anyone else run into this or have any ideas?

i have concerns about using the printify mockups or not.  
on the other hand, using third-party mockups is a lot of work.  
  
pro :   
- easy to use  
- made by professionals  
- other ?  
  
contra :   
- look cheap  
- boring  
- used by many shops (not sure, but i think so)  
- other ?

my take on this is that they can be used by some shops, but are a wrong choice for other shops.

1802,2.5 million in sales while paid ads are turned off,27,1d0uu8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1d0uu8q/25_million_in_sales_while_paid_ads_are_turned_off/,11,2024-05-26 12:57:43,"before i get into the good parts of this post here's a quick disclaimer:  
- this brand did 1.8 million the year before  
- i do not own this brand, i was hired to build a cult-following  
- paid ads were being ran for the first quarter of the year but not converting well

that's relevant information because not every brand can see massive success without paid ads. most of the things i talk about in this post are pretty much useless if you do under 15k/month. now that that's out of the way, let's talk about what i did to nearly double this brand's revenue without dumping more money into ads.

**for those who don't like reading, i'll summarize what i did right here: i built a community around the brand.**

so i'll break down what i did into 5 steps:

1. obtained a shit load of user-generated content

i was able to get 300 videos of people using the brand's products in under 60 days.  
this is easier than it seems. people pay influencers thousands to pose with their products. for a brand with a bit of traction, the value in user-generated content is to get products in front of a larger audience; not necessarily for social proof (like it is for smaller brands). so with that being said, don't spend a lot of money on ugc content unless it's for a promotional post on a page with a large following.

don't fixate on having the prettiest videos. give a wide variety of people the opportunity to submit content.

3 ways you can get user-generated content for free/cheap are:

- use your social media channels to offer a free product in exchange for a video review  
- setup a review email flow, offer existing customers a chance at a full refund for a video testimonial that meets certain criteria  
- directly contact influencers and negotiate/hire someone with a network of influencers to do the negotiation process for you

2. created a blog

i designed a blog page on the website and posted on it 1-2 times per week. i used ai to generate in-season ideas for blog posts, then got my copywriter to do some research and come up with short blog posts that were informative and read well. p.s just using chatgpt to pump out blog content can work but the content will never be as engaging as content written by a real person that understands the marketing angle. we also tried to add user-generated content on the blog pages as much as we could.

this is by far the easiest way to get people back onto your site without them feeling like you're trying to sell them more products. this is the base of the next 3 steps. good blog content makes people in your niche excited to hear from you. this will boost your email open rates, allow you to post in groups that are heavily moderated against promotions, and give you a lot of niche-specific copywriting to work with.

3. created a subreddit (or any type of group)

i created a subreddit for this brand, then i spent hours finding niche-relevant content. then, i queued a whole bunch of posts. i did a mix of reposting content from tiktok, instagram, youtube, etc, and posting the site's blog posts and ugc content. growing the community was tricky but once i got some momentum going it was almost growing itself.

there's major upside to owning a community inside of your niche. you can block your competitors from posting in your sub and post as much promotional content as you want. you can also mix content, so people have no idea if you're promoting a store, sharing a funny photo, or giving a useful recommendation. you'd honestly be shocked by the amount of traffic our weekly pinned post brought to the site.

4. discord community

i used social media, reddit, and emails to grow the community to 11 thousand members in under a year. customers were giving design ideas, connecting with store employees, and volunteering to send content with products for free.

this is like a reddit community but more personal. the main difference between the discord and the reddit is that the discord is branded and the reddit is just niche specific. this is a good place to run competitions and polls, and also just interact with customers on a personal level. you can get a tone of ugc from a discord community if you use it right.

5. email and sms marketing

i saved the best for last. normally my posts are mainly focused on emails but i thought i'd switch it up today to truly convey what goes on behind the scenes of well-coordinated email/sms marketing.  
think of emails as an ongoing conversation between you and your customer. you play the role of a friend recommending things to a peer. you already know things about them, like their interests, location, and buying habits. now use segmentation and predictive analytics to make sure relevant content gets sent to interested people. i'll leave it at that.

but before i leave i'll share some more info about this brand that may be relevant. it's a breed-specific animal brand, this brand has been around for about 4 years and has consistently grown 30-40% each year with last year being an outlier (almost doubled sales), the people in this niche are extremely passionate about their pets so this may have made it easier for me to grow a community this quickly, and the 2.5 million that i am attributing to my systems are just the sales that came from email and sms marketing.

from what i can gather, there are two ways to deal with this. 

1) sync published products in bulk within printify by ""publishing"" already-published products, and only ticking the  ""colors, sizes, prices and skus"" option.  

2) don't let printify give a stock status to etsy at all to begin with, and if a sale comes through for a product that's out of stock, contact buyer and see if they're ok with a delay

is that my only two options here?  am i missing something?

what are the pros and cons of each?  

i assume that if i go with option 1, then i need to manually refresh/sync this stuff daily just to keep everything as updated as possibly in the etsy store.  if i go with option 2, i don't have to refresh/sync daily, but then i get to deal with the one-offs when someone purchases something that's out of stock.

# paint/print

first off the print/paint looks like it was painted on with a paintbrush. it's hard to describe but i have a hoodie i own with a similar size white print on it and there the paint is sturdy, solid and raised above the fabric whereas the printify hoodie looks like it was painted deep into the fabric.

here are some pictures of a retail hoodie i got from an irl store:

[here the paint looks solid and is raised on top of the fabric](https://preview.redd.it/4dwceyki48wc1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=41da67a8ffd8db6a89856de45572fd0b8e8da5fe)

now here's a photo with both side by side:

[paint on the left frankly looks like it was painted on with a paintbrush whilst the right side looks like a normal print you would find on everyday hoodies or t-shirts](https://preview.redd.it/050a99zx48wc1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dc60cd22cce1b71e22fe08c24836620cf74d77c)

also the black fabric sticks out from underneath the paint but it's hard to get it to show on camera.

# smudging

there is also significant smudging of the print. here's another picture where it's more obvious:

[smudging of the print highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/9wmkzvm168wc1.png?width=2096&format=png&auto=webp&s=e794b6238e29060fe8f87a9daef7cdd55f4270fe)

i don't think the smudging is a result of blurriness from my upload because i uploaded my design as an svg. i am also scared to wash the hoodie fearing it might smear the paint even more or maybe the whole design will wash off, who knows.

is this print quality to be expected with printondemand? i definitely wouldn't want to sell any designs if the print quality is like this. frankly i would be embarrassed to sell merch or any kind artwork with this quality of print.

edit: i submitted a request for a reprint and it got approved super fast (15 mins). will update this thread once the replacement arrives.

update: the order came very fast, replacement order was created 24th apr 12:45 pm and arrived on the 26th which is genuinely impressive. the bad news is that the replacement still has the same issue of fabric sticking out through the paint. i have messaged support again about the issue and will update further

last update: after messaging support i said if tss can't print properly then just give me a refund and they did. i'd like to add that printify support was amazing through this whole process, the site is very nice and easy to use, it's just a shame that some print providers have such poor quality. i have attached some pictures of the reprint:

\-customer paid an additional $7 for shipping. order total is now $35.49

\-my total profit on etsy is $28.50 for that specific sale

&#x200b;

on the printify site, it says my production cost was $16.79 + $7 to ship, total being $23.79

&#x200b;

so...my profit was $28.50 (etsy) - $23.79 (printify) = $4.71

&#x200b;

if my customer paid for shipping (that was synced to etsy via printify), why did i not keep the shipping fee as profit in my etsy store? where did the shipping etsy fee go, because printify still had me pay the $7 shipping. in summary, the shipping fee my etsy customer paid seems to have vanished and i was still required to pay shipping in my printify account.

&#x200b;

i thought the shipping fee my etsy customer paid rolled over into printify. where the heck did it go?!

1968,Delayed Fulfillment from SwiftPOD,1,1c3kaqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Printify/comments/1c3kaqy/delayed_fulfillment_from_swiftpod/,17,2024-04-14 10:49:18,"i'm a new pod shop and have had a couple of dozen sales so far.  but my early and limited experience with swiftpod has me feeling very uneasy.  there has been more than one issue with my 50 sales so far concerning swiftpod.  and here is my latest, a single tshirt ordered on the 11th, originally estimated to ship on the 13th, now estimated to ship on the 16th.

https://preview.redd.it/je7tv4tg9duc1.png?width=1134&format=png&auto=webp&s=33037594aa61680f3e607b6ec9f8cc614e408308

i assumed some people choose a provider based on turn around speed.  and swiftpod is advertised at an average of 1.9 days.  well, 5 days is more than 2x the average.  and this isn't the first time.  


i understand there are reasons - but it would be very helpful if shop owners had access to those reasons.  is it the color, the garment, the weather?  seriously - why can't we be informed as to why an order is being drastically delayed?  


and when i try to reach switftpod direct, i am routed back to printify.  and unfortunately, my experience with printify is zero assistance in solving the problem.  being told to wait until the date swiftpod claims delivery doesn't solve the problem of why this is consistently happening.  i'd say i've got a 10% poor experience so far.  that's horrible!  


this post is not to be a baseless rant.  if the issue is offering a color that is causing these issues - i will remove it from the shop.  or if the design is a pia to print.  i will remove it.  but not sharing what the problem is and giving shop owners the ability to make an executive decision is just nuts.  


and for those who suggest switching from swiftpod to someone else, there are not any other vendors that offer sleeve printing and/or the volume of colors swift does.  but maybe that will need to be done to address the issues and that is a massive amount of work to redo every item again to simply dump an unreliable fulfillment center.  if my entire apparel shop has to go through that process, i would probably consider trying printful.
